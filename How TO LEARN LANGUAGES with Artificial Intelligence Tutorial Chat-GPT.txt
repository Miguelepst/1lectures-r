Before artificial intelligences control humanity, we must take advantage of all the possibilities that they offer. I'm not promoting abuse; I just want to use them well. Please don't kill me. When I start talking to the camera, I feel embarrassed. I was practicing earlier, and everything was coming naturally, but now, in front of the camera, nothing feels natural. I feel like I'm being watched. What do you see? It's not true. Thank you for being here. Leave a like if you're enjoying this, and well, if you're here, I'll teach you how to learn any language with ChatGPT. ChatGPT literally replaces not just one, but many tools, and worse, even people, when it comes to us learning a language.

What is Chat-GPT? First, I'll explain something you probably already know, but just in case there are people living under a rock, I'll explain it. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence engine. I don't know if I said that correctly, but the point is, it's an artificial intelligence. It's a chat. You write things to it, and it responds as if it were another person with artificial intelligence and a lot of information inside, like Google but smarter. I won't go into exactly what ChatGPT is; you'll figure it out when you start using it. I'll leave the link below for you to try it out and to try out all the methods I'm going to share with you. In this video, I have six points that I'll give you so you can get the most out of ChatGPT for learning any language.

Point number one: let's see how it beats Google Translate. And in the other points, because I'm too lazy to say two, three, four, five, six, I'll explain how it will help us regardless of our level in each language, depending on whether you're very good or very clueless. I understand; I'm pretty clueless in some languages, you know, very little if you know a lot. How it's going to function in that aspect of our private teacher. We'll see what the definition of "function" is. Function definition: to perform the functions of an occupation or position. In this case, how ChatGPT is going to perform the functions of a private language teacher. And also, we'll see how it's going to replace real people to help us practice conversations.

Function one of ChatGPT: the translation function. We've all used Google Translate at some point. How many of your English tasks are not partially or completely done by Google Translate? Don't feel bad; I've done it too. But how many times has Google Translate failed us? Let's say Google Translate is simply too direct, too literal. Languages are not always direct or literal. And each language has many ways to say the same thing; a word can have several meanings depending on the context, grammar, verb tense, the words included in the sentence, or simply because that's how it is. You have to understand when learning a language; there are things that are just like that because they are. That also makes it difficult because things are just because they are. That's life; there are things you just have to accept, like when your ex who cheated on you leaves you. Just accept it, move on, leave a like. Since Google Translate is based on patterns compared from a massive amount of documents, but it's still just a database, it's not an attempt or anything similar to a human brain that thinks and communicates as a human does. And it will understand specific contexts that give meaning to many words or sentences. In contrast, ChatGPT, as I said before, is an artificial intelligence that attempts to simulate us but smarter. So I'll give you several examples of translations Google does versus translations ChatGPT does. I'm telling you, from now on, if you want to translate something, use ChatGPT; it's more reliable. It still makes mistakes because ChatGPT is not a native speaker of all those languages; it's still an artificial intelligence trained based on information. What I can assure you 100% is that it's much better than Google Translate. I'm telling you, others are telling you, people who learn and speak many languages are telling you. You can try it yourself; take a long text, translate it once with Google Translate, translate it once with ChatGPT, and tell me which one you notice is better, especially in English, where the translation topic is more polished. But in other languages, it's not so perfect. Even so, it's still better than Google Translate. I've had experiences where I've put slightly long sentences in German with too many grammatical things, like grammatical cases, prepositions, etc., and Google Translate messes up, puts things wrong, very simple things that one could overlook but that I know because I have an advanced level of German, and I even find myself there correcting it, "Hey, you shouldn't have put this because it's the dative case," and so on. It apologizes and changes it, but it can make mistakes at more advanced levels. But it can make mistakes, and if it happens with German, imagine maybe with Chinese, Korean, Arabic. As I said, despite all these flaws, it's still much more reliable than Google Translate, so use it.

Function two: text or sentence adaptation. When you're learning a language, many people recommend consuming content in that language, mainly in terms of reading. For example, reading books, newspaper articles, or simply a website. Often, we want to read something in the language we're learning to practice our reading, but often the text may be much more complicated than we know, so in the end, it doesn't help us at all because it's too complex, we don't understand anything, or we have to be pausing literally all the time to translate what it means, and in the end, it's not feasible. What you can do is find a text you like, that you want to read because it catches your attention, a book or an article, etc., copy it, paste it into ChatGPT, and ask it, "Please, make this text simpler for me. Please adapt this text to A1 level in German," or "Please adapt this text to B2 level in English." That way, the text becomes more complicated or simpler according to your level, and it can be simpler for your comprehension. You still get the same information in a slightly simpler way that will help you understand it and improve gradually. You can even ask it to explain certain words you don't understand from certain sentences or texts or to give you a summary of them, which can be very useful for studying in terms of reading in a language. For example, it can mark all the local prepositions, all the definite and indefinite articles, all the verbs, all the personal pronouns, etc.

Function three: one of the most incredible ones, test creation. Now, you're out there, you want to know more or less something, you don't have a teacher, or you're too lazy to be looking for such and such. You can tell ChatGPT, "Please create a questionnaire of 20 questions at the A1 level in Dutch." ChatGPT says, "Sure, here you go. I have a 30-question Dutch questionnaire, even if it's multiple-choice or
