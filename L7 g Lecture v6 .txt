ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a young boy who CAREFULLY built a model airplane. 

He worked on it SLOWLY, putting each piece together SIMPLY and EASILY. 

His dream was to fly it LOUDLY across the park SUCCESSFULLY. 

He tried many times and failed TOO often. 

But COMPLETELY determined, he kept trying.

MEANWHILE, in the park, an old man watched the boy daily. 

SUDDENLY, one day, the wind was perfect. 

LATER, the boy threw the plane with all his might. 

AFTERWARDS, he watched it soar. 

WHEN the plane landed, the boy ran to it FINALLY seeing his work fly. 

AT THE END of the day, the boy was so happy.

BY THE TIME he went home, the sun was setting. 

BY THE WAY, he met the old man who smiled. 

BEFORE he left, the old man gave him a tip to make the plane fly better. 

FOR A LONG time, the boy had been waiting for someone to notice his efforts. 

I'M NOT SURPRISED, the boy thought, as he felt the old man knew much about planes. 

"YOU'RE JOKING?," the boy said when the old man told him he had once been a pilot. 

"I CAN IMAGINE!" the boy exclaimed, imagining flying real airplanes.

WHAT A NIGHTMARE, he thought, if the plane would have broken. 

SOUNDS AWFUL if he would never have met the pilot. 

SOUNDS TERRIBLE, that he almost gave up. 

I DON'T BLAME YOU, said the pilot, understanding the difficulty of pursuing dreams. 

WOW, THAT'S AMAZING! exclaimed the boy when the pilot showed him an old photo of a plane he had flown.

OH, how excited the boy was. 

I SEE, said the boy, when the pilot explained aerodynamics. 

WHAT YOU MEAN is that the shape is important, the boy realized. 

LUCKY YOU, to have learned these things, the boy told the pilot. 

"OH MY GOD! WERE YOU REALLY a war pilot?" asked the boy, amazed. 

SO, the pilot answered his many questions.

WHAT HAPPENED? Why did you stop flying? The boy inquired. 

"YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS," the boy reacted to the story of the pilot's last flight. 

"I am SERIOUS," the pilot replied with a twinkle in his eye. 

They spent the whole afternoon discussing planes. 

Time passed JUST as fast as the boy's plane flying in the wind. 

It was ALREADY sunset and YET, the boy wanted to talk more. 

STILL, it was getting dark.

FOR AND SINCE that day, the boy visited the old pilot. 

Many seasons had passed, AGO, YESTERDAY, and THE OTHER DAY LAST WEEK. 

Now it was LAST MONTH, then LAST YEAR, but the boy never forgot the pilot's lessons. 

He USED TO think he knew everything about planes until the pilot taught him more. 

indeed, the boy often laughed recalling their first meeting. 

I WOULD always remember, the boy thought, the day I really learned to fly.
