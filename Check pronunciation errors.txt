It's easy to see how "uncouth" and "uncle" can sound similar when spoken quickly or without clear pronunciation. Here are a few tips to help you pronounce "uncouth" more clearly:

1. **Break it down**: Say it slowly and in parts: un-couth.
2. **Emphasize the "th"**: Make sure to pronounce the "th" sound at the end clearly. Itâ€™s like the sound in "think" or "thought."
3. **Practice with sentences**: Use the word in simple sentences to practice the pronunciation in context. For example:
   - "His behavior was quite uncouth."
   - "The party became uncouth as the night went on."

Try saying these sentences slowly at first, then gradually increase your speed as you become more comfortable with the pronunciation.
