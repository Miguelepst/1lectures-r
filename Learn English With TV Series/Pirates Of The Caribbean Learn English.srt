1:05
situations that can be useful in gaining  English fluency so are you ready let's Dive
1:09
In
1:33
this is either Madness or Brilliance it's  remarkable how often those two TR come
1:38
inside
2:09
everyone stay calm we are  taking over the ship I of
2:14
us this ship cannot be crewed by  two men you'll never make it out  
2:22
of the bay son I'm Captain Jack Sparrow savy
2:44
this is either Madness or brains if somebody says  that something is madness they mean that it's too  
2:51
dangerous or stupid to be done the rest of  you will be tried and punished accordingly  
3:00
what are you doing Z this is madness what  I should have done years ago more literally  
3:05
Madness refers to the state of being mentally ill  especially severely Brilliance is the quality of  
3:12
somebody or something that is brilliant to  be brilliant is to have great intelligence  
3:17
or skill only a person who wanted to find the  stone find it but not use it would be able to  
3:28
get it that is one of my more brilliant  ideas will means that their idea of going  
3:37
under water to steal the ship is either very  stupid or intelligent this is either Madness  
3:45
or brains so the word either is used here  as a way to refer to one choice between two
3:51
possibilities there's only one way  this ends cow either you you die or I
4:01
do this is either Madness or Brains it's  remarkable how often those two traits Co  
4:12
inside something considered remarkable is unusual  special interesting or excellent if you take this  
4:19
word literally you can figure out more of its  meaning remarkable things make you want to make  
4:23
a remark about them they get you talking because  they're so special or good getting a be on a test  
4:30
isn't remarkable unless you usually get D's  getting to meet the president would be pretty  
4:35
remarkable this word is usually safe for things  that are truly exceptional remarkable feat don't  
4:43
you think to enter Hogwart Castle on one's own  completely undetected quite remarkable yeah a  
4:51
trait is a particular characteristic attribute  or quality that something or somebody has for  
4:56
example the labrador dog breed is known to  be very social and familyfriendly these are  
5:02
Labrador traits or if a soccer player can run  incredibly fast we say that speed is one of  
5:08
his traits it's remarkable how often those  two traits coincide often means frequently  
5:15
for example if you see your friends every day you  see each other often so Jack is saying that it's  
5:21
really interesting how frequently Madness and  Brilliance happen at the same time that is they
5:26
coincide
5:36
everyone stay calm we're taking over the ship  to take over is to assume or take control of  
5:43
something in this case it also implies the action  of taking control of something without having the  
5:48
authority to do so and possibly with Force deck  Cutler Becket has the heart of Davy Jones he  
5:56
controls the Flying Dutchman he's taking over  the seas a ship is a large boat like this one  
6:03
while boat is a more General word that can  refer to watercraft of different sizes we  
6:07
only call ships the larger ones like the one  seen in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies  
6:13
other ways to call different types of boats and  water vehicles are vessel cruise and Ferry ship  
6:20
is also a verb meaning to transport Goods when  you buy something online the item can be shipped  
6:25
to you on a ship but it can also be shipped on a  truck or a train for example everyone stay calm  
6:32
we are taking over the ship I of us as you know  in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies we can  
6:39
hear many different Expressions about sailing but  an even more unique and iconic type of vocabulary  
6:44
that can also be heard are the words associated  with pirates in formally known as pirate English  
6:50
which comes mostly from old British and  Scottish English I is another way to say  
6:55
yes will you sail to the ends of the Earth and  Beyond to fetch back wited Jack and impress us
7:04
p i i
7:14
i yes a vast means stop normally used as a  command to give somebody the order to stop I of
7:29
B this ship cannot be crewed by two men a crew  is an organized group of workers for example  
7:39
a crew might keep a ship sailing smoothly or  build a house in an organized way either way  
7:45
crew implies cooperation amongst workers as a  verb if you crew a boat you become part of the  
7:51
workers helping to sail it and what makes you  think you're worthy to Crew The Black Pearl  
7:57
truth be told I never s to die life in this  scene the official means that the ship needs  
8:03
more than two people in the crew it cannot be  crewed by two men this ship cannot be crewed by  
8:11
two men you'll never make it out of the bay a  bay is an area of water surrounded by land on  
8:17
three sides with one way out to the ocean to  make it is to accomplish something to do it  
8:23
successfully for example in reaching a place  going somewhere attending an event or arriving  
8:28
on time for something example I can't make  it to the concert I have to work it can also  
8:35
imply the idea of surviving or continuing  to exist after going through a difficult
8:39
situation would never made it of course
8:49
not in the scene the official means that will and  Jack will certainly not have success sailing the  
8:58
ship or even even trying to leave the bay you'll  never make it out of the bay with this one line  
9:04
you can learn a lot about connected speech and  pronunciation in English let's listen to it  
9:09
again closely you'll never make it out of the  bay you'll never make it out of the bay first  
9:16
you will notice he connects the words make and  it together resulting in one simple sound make  
9:22
it this happens because the word make ends in  a k sound most of the words ending with the  
9:28
letter E in English have have it as a silente  you should not pronounce it for example save  
9:34
pirate male you will also notice he connects  the phrase of verb make it with the word out  
9:41
while making use of the tap t sound make it  out also note that he applies the tap t to  
9:47
the letter T in the word out as well you'll never  make it out of the bay finally we can hear a word  
9:55
that is commonly mispronounced by Learners the  function word of many Learners will actually  
10:00
make the mistake of pronouncing the sound of  the letter F in reality what should be said  
10:05
is the sound of the letter v v of now that we  learned how to correctly pronounce the entire  
10:12
sentence let's practice you'll never make it  out of the bay you'll never make it out of the
10:18
bay you'll never make it out of the bay here  are some other examples of these sounds with  
10:28
the TV serious friends you know I have to  find a job where I carry a smaller table or  
10:33
a job where you don't have to carry a table you  mean like a doctor you mean like the doctor now

11:55
phrase you know that is the child of boot  strap Bill Turner his only child Savi is he
12:05
now this word is associated with knowledge  and understanding and nowadays it is more  
12:13
commonly used for example to Define  somebody who has a good understanding  
12:17
or knowledge about a practical subject so for  example if somebody has a lot of experience  
12:22

SOS back to the Interceptor
13:42
now thank you Commodore for getting us ready  to make way we've had a hard time of it by
13:55
ourselves s top cells and clear up this  mess with the window quarter a Stern we  
14:03
won't catch them I don't need to catch them  just get them in range of the long nines help  
14:07
come about run out the guns we have to find  our own ships huh I'd rather see her at the  
14:14
bottom of the ocean than in the hands of  a pirate Comm door is disabled the rudder
14:21
chainer abandon sh
14:34
that's got to be the best part  I've ever seen so it would
14:39
seem
14:52
Comm they're taking the ship sparrow  they're taking the da in activities  
15:05
involving sailing it is common to give boats  and ships names in this scene Jack and Will  
15:10
are apparently trying to steal The Dauntless  ship the word dauntless is an adjective that  
15:15
refers to showing determination and bravery  that has no fear example the soldiers showed  
15:22
dauntless courage in the war more common  is the adjective daunting which means  
15:27
that something seems very difficult or int  intimidating example learning English is a  
15:31
daunting task but that doesn't mean it has  to be boring Commodore is a title given to  
15:36
a naal officer that is a military Authority  at CA who ranks above a captain and Below an
15:42
admiral turn Da rash Turner too rash we say that  something is rash when it's done impulsively  
15:54
without careful consideration of the possible  consequences of the action example getting  
15:59
married so quickly was a rash decision bring  her around bring her around although this is  
16:06
not common in English in sailing it's also common  to informally refer to a ship as a she addressing  
16:12
it as a female instead of as an object it start  every cabin every hole down to the building here  
16:20
Commodore Norrington is referring to three  different types of areas in a ship the cabins  
16:25
are the rooms where people normally spend time or  sleep gold refers to the space in which goods are  
16:31
carried The Villages are the bottom inside part of  a ship where dirty water collects oh yeah so every  
16:37
week we help luners like you understand fast  speaking natives without getting lost without  
16:42
missing the jokes and without subtitles just  like BAGI who says that thanks to our videos  
16:47
he went from intermediate to advanced level  and now he can understand natives in Canada  
16:53
where he's living now you can take your English  to the next level too all you have to do is hit  
16:57
that subscribe button and the sell down  below so you don't miss any of our new
17:00
lessons sailor back to the Interceptor now a  sailor is someone who works on a boat or ship  
17:15
and follows the orders of an official or Commander  Interceptor is the name of the other ship in the  
17:21
scene which Jack and Will are now stealing instead  the verb to intercept is to stop something from  
17:26
reaching its destination for example example in  American football when you intercept a pass you  
17:31
grab the ball that your opponent had thrown to  a member of his own team or in a more practical  
17:37
example if you're planning a surprise party for  your friend and she arrives half an hour early  
17:41
you might run to intercept her while everyone  else hides to surpriser in the movie the ship  
17:47
is probably called Interceptor because of  its speed and ability to catch up to other
17:51
ships thank you color for getting  us ready to make way to make way  
18:03
for somebody or something normally  means to allow space for someone else  
18:06
or something to pass what's going  on here come on might way might
18:12
way thank you cidor for getting us ready to  make way however in this scene to make way  
18:22
is a nautical term referring to make progress or  travel this is a very unusual use of this phras  
18:27
a verb we've had a hard time of it by ourselves  if you have a hard time doing something it is a  
18:34
period of difficulty for you it is not easy see  that's why I did so bad on this test I'm having  
18:41
a hard time concentrating Jack is jokingly telling  Commodore Norrington that will and him would have  
18:47
had difficulty leaving by themselves that is  alone we had a whole time of it by ourselves  
18:54
this sentence gives a good example of the third  conditional in English conditional SES in English  
18:59
are normally formed by two parts of a sentence  the main clause and the conditional Clause let's  
19:05
Analyze This example if you had helped me I would  have passed the test the third conditional tense  
19:11
seen above talks about the past it's used to  describe a situation that did not happen and  
19:17
to imagine the result of this situation so in this  case you did not help me but if you had helped me  
19:25
I would have passed the test now let's analyze  this sentence said by by Jack Sparrow we would  
19:30
have had a hard time of it by ourselves as you  might have noticed this sentence contains only the  
19:37
conditional Clause it only informs of the possible  result of the situation his previous line was  
19:43
actually the one that served as the main Clause  thank you Commodore for getting us ready to make
19:49
way we've had a hard time of it by ourselves  so he's basically saying that if commodor  
19:58
Norrington had not helped them they would have  had a hard time to travel stop yelling all I'm  
20:07
saying is if you had told me vegetarian  lasagna I would have made vegetarian
20:13
lasagna H we have to move if we had lost  we would have made them get rid of the
20:23
bird no do you want to learn more about  conditionals in English check out this other  
20:33
lesson we did with the TV series friends after  you finished learning with this one set top Sals  
20:40
and clear up this mess a sail is a big piece of  material attached to a sailboat that catches wind  
20:45
and helps it move through the water top Sails are  the sails located on top of the larger main sails  
20:52
to set sail refers to the action of opening the  sail so the ship starts moving and traveling by  
20:58
saying clear up this mess Commodore Norrington  is informally telling the other official to fix  
21:03
the problem they've created with the wind  quter St we won't catch them I don't need  
21:07
to catch them just get them in range of the long  nines quarter a Stern are very specific nautical  
21:12
terms that refer to the direction from which the  wind is coming and hitting the ship long nines is  
21:17
an informal way to refer to Naval long guns or  cannons such as these used for firing at other  
21:23
ships and buildings catch I don't need to catch  them just get them in range of the long Nines  
21:27
in this case range refers to a distance in which  you can still reach your target for example this  
21:33
radar has great range it can detect other ships  more than 200 miles away the Commodore is saying  
21:39
that he doesn't intend to catch will and Jack  stolin ship he just wants to position his ship  
21:44
in range to fire at them come about run out the  guns come about is a sailing term that means to  
21:52
change direction the long guns on these old ships  were mounted on wooden structures with wheels to  
21:58
help them move move them around by saying run out  the guns the official is ordering the crew to move  
22:03
the guns and point them out in position to fire  we have to find our own ships huh sir is a noun  
22:10
used as a formal and very polite way of speaking  to a man especially one who you are providing a  
22:16
service to or who is in a position of Authority  or older than you so for example a waiter at a  
22:22
restaurant might call a male customer sir or as  in the case of this scene the official calls his  
22:27
Superior the Commodore sir many Learners overuse  this word however in the United States this word  
22:33
is rarely used by native speakers outside of  these cases I'd rather see her at the bottom  
22:39
of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate I would  rather or I'd rather is a phrase used for saying  
22:45
that you would prefer to do something or that you  would prefer that something happened example I'd  
22:51
rather you didn't mention this matter to anyone  else he doesn't want to go out he'd rather stay  
22:56
at home and play video games Loki for all his  grave imbalance understood rulers I know I never  
23:02
will I'd rather be a good man than a great king  commodor Norrington is saying that he would rather  
23:10
destroy and sink his own ship that got stolen the  Interceptor than leaving it with the pirate Jack  
23:15
Sparrow come door he disabled the rudder chainer  the rudder is a flat piece of wood or metal at  
23:23
the back of the boat or aircraft like this that  is moved from side to side in order to control  
23:28
the direction of the vehicle in the water or air  check out this example of the word from another  
23:33
nautical movie Titanic 26 years of experience  working against him he figures anything big enough  
23:40
to syn the ship they're going to see in time to  turn the ship's too big with too small a Rudder  
23:46

23:53
with Pirates of the Caribbean then I bet you'll  really love our lesson that we did recently with  
23:58
Titanic you can find that by clicking up here  the rudder chains connect the steering wheel to  
24:04
the rudder in the scene the Sailor informs that  Jack has disabled the rudder chain if you disable  
24:10
something you turn it off or make it unable  to work properly commor is disabled the rudder
24:17
chainer she that's got to be the best  part I've ever seen so it would seem so  
24:36
would seam is a way to say that something  seems to be the case that is apparently
24:40

25:10
coincide
