I "Aladdin" with Will Smith

Oh great one who "summons" me,
I stand by my oath.
Loyalty to wishes three.
You look like a prince.
on the outside.
"But I didn't change anything" on the inside.
Showtime!
No, I'm in charge.
Okay, I say when it's time.

Since you're watching this, you probably know the story.

When Aladdin rubs the lamp, the genie emerges out of it to grant him three wishes.

Ten thousand years...

...will give you such a crick in the neck.

When the Genie first appears in the movie, he makes a little speech.

Let's take a look at what he says.

Oh great one who summons me,

I "stand by my oath."

To summon someone means to order someone to be present.

We can use this word when talking about paranormal beings, like a ghost, demon,

spirit or a fantasy being.

I'm still stuck on the fact that we're trying to summon a ghost named Candy.

This can also mean to order somebody to appear in court.

This is the use you can see in this Game of Thrones clip.

Inform Tywin Lannister

that he has bee ummoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

The Genie, then says, "l stand by my oath."

An oath is a formal and very serious promise.

Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

Not until your debt is paid.

I've sworn no oath.

If you swear an oath, then you're supposed to stand by said oath.

Stand by in this case means to keep your promise.

I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.

The Genie's oath is that he must grant the possessor of the lamp three wishes,

even if the lamp falls into the hands of a villain.

On the outside refers to the way a person looks, and in contrast, on the inside refers to that person's character, values, etc.

How he or she is as a person, rather than how he or she looks.

Look, I care about you a lot, but

we are very different people.

Are you breaking up with me?

No, no, I'm just pointing out that

you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.

We say "it's showtime" or just showtime literally when it is time for a play or performance to begin.

However, here we hear it used figuratively, to show that something exciting is about to happen.

In this case, the exciting thing is that the Genie is expecting Aladdin to approach the princess

and confess his love for her.

Aladdin does the total opposite of showing that level of enthusiasm.

He says " No, I'm charge, I say when it's time."

To be in charge means that you are the boss.

Sheldon, yo 're not in charge.

It's my idea. I'm in charge.

We're now going to watch some behind the scenes footage

and commentary from he actors who played the main characters in Aladdin.

This live action, Aladdin, took my breath away.

Growing up with this character,

and I always remembered Jasmine as strong and knows her own mind.

When I think of when I was a little girl,

she was the character I would always play because I could relate in some way.

What we're trying to do is,

re-imagine with a modern twist to it.

What Naomi has done with Jasmine is powerful and really unique.

She brings that sense of empowerment to the character.

As a character that you know, but say refreshing incarnation.

Princess Jasmine wants the best for Agrabah and what's best for them is that she leads.

But rather than say she wanted to lead,

she shows the skills and the qualities of a leader.

She has big aspirations

And she sees a future that is greater for the kingdom and the city of Agrabah.

This story is a progression of how she finally speaks out

and becomes the leader that she's destined to be.

This live action, Aladdin, took my breath away.

A live action is a movie with real actors, as opposed to a cartoon or animated movie.

She says the movie "took her breath away."

This is a great way of saying that something is extremely beautiful or surprising.

Did I take your breath away?

Absolutely!

You can also use this expression in an adjective form, saying something is breathtaking.

Pay attention to the difference in the following examples.

The views will take your breath away.

The views are breathtaking.

This is also a very famous song I'm sure you've heard at some point.

In this song, this phrase is used to describe

someone who's deeply in love with someone else.

take my breath away

When I think of when I was a little girl,

she was the character I would always play because I could relate in some way.

If you can relate to someone else, it means that you can understand his or her problems, situation, etc.

You can understand how that person feels because you've felt the same at some point in the past.

All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it's been nice talking to you,

but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.

I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.

Usually we say the phrase "l can relate to that" to show sympathy for someone.

I can relate to that. I also have a difficult job.

Don't confuse this with when we say "related to someone".

If you're related to someone, it means that person is your relative (a member of your family).


Are you related to him?
-Yes, he's my cousin.

What we're trying to do is,

re-imagine with a modern twist to it.

A twist is a slight modification of something so that it has a new look or feel.

For example, as you'll see later in the video Will Smith talks about this,

the part of the Genie was masterfully played by Robin Williams in the 90s.

You can say that Will Smith gave his Own personal twist to the character.

Also, in a movie, a twist is a sudden change in the story.

Oh, I can't wait to see that movie.

Is it good?

Awesome.

Wait, totally hypothetically, do you like movies

with a shocking twist where all the main characters die at the end?

Yes

You will love this movie.

What Naomi has done with Jasmine is powerful and really unique.

She brings that sense of empowerment to the character.

Unique means unusually good and special.

Naomi's twist on the princess is, as Will describes it, a sense of empowerment.

To empower someone is to give them power to do something;

to give someone more control over their own life or situation.

Rachel, you have to read this book.

It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

It's about how women need to become more empowered.

My compass...

is unique.

"Unique" here having the meaning of "broken."

True enough, this compass does not point north.

Where does it point?

It points to the thing you want most in this world.

As a character that you know, bu say refreshing incarnation. 

An incarnation is the embodiment of a spirit, deity, or character.

So in this case, the incarnation is the physical realization of the imaginary character,

Jasmine, in the reaI world.

He defines this new character as refreshing, which means new in a very positive way.

We often say something is refreshing when it brings a pleasing change to something.

So what he means is that Naomi played Jasmine in such a way

that now the character feels completely different.

I got to tell you, it's refreshing, talking to someone like you for a change.

Someone like me?

Yeah, someone who doesn't take himself too seriously and who's not

constantly trying to impress me with how much stuff he's got.

But rather than say she wanted to lead,

she shows the skills and the qualities of a leader.

We use this construction to indicate that something is not true and that something else is. 

I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words.

He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather thiah destroy them.

This story is a progression of how she finally speaks out

and becomes the leader that she's "destined to be."

To speak out means to give your opinion about something in public, especially in order to protest against or defend something.

Activists speak out against injustice. 

A group of parents spoke out against bullying in the school.

In the movie; Jasmine speaks out about injustice;

particularly, the fact that a woman can't rule the city.

On the other hand, if we say that someone is destined to be or do something, it means that it's very likely that what we're saying will
happen to that person in the future.

Her parents are both doctors. I think that's also what she's destined to be.

He was always destined to be the star that he is today.

One Of the things that I love about Aladdin is that is a fairytale story

in another part of the world.

In this world of Agrabah.

We shot out in Jordan, a place called Wadi Rum.

You can just feel the history in the sand.

I think it adds a level of reality.

Aladdin!

Are we in trouble?

Only if you get caught.

Aladdin!

One of the things that I love about Aladdin  

A fairytale is a story for children about magical creatures,

like Little Red Riding Hood or Cinderella.

Aladdin is also a fairytale.

To shoot means to film or photograph.

The Lord of the Ring was shot in New Zealand.

To be in trouble means to be in a problematic situation.

What are they doing to him?

He's in trouble!

To get caught means for someone, especially an authority figure, to see you breaking a rule or law.

His parents caught him smoking.

It can even more literally suggest to become a prisoner of someone

or to be unable to escape because someone's holding you.

In this scene, people are trying to catch Aladdin and Jasmine because they did something wrong. 

All I'm saying is,

if you leave this place,

you will get caught.

You know, stepping onto set the first time.

It was uh...

It was insane when you see they actually built this whole city.

It really was magical!

You could genuinely get lost in the streets.

It's just so visually stunning.

And lhe palace, and Jasmine's room.

The throne room. Just took my breath away.

From the costumes to the sets,

it was unlike anything I've ever seen.

I'm excited to sit in an audience to see it

because everyone really doubled and tripled down on getting it right.

To step onto a place means that your feet touch the ground or floor of a particular location.

I've been to the Camp Nou dozens of times,

but today was the first time I actually stepped onto the field.

Insane means crazy and it is used as slang to describe something unbelievable.

Just give us the cheapest room you have.

Unfortunately, the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

That's insane.

It's totally insane.

You can also say this as insanely to intensify the meaning of an adjective.

You know, the first two years we were together, we were insanely romantic.

Then it became about parenting and working.

0k, those strippers were insanely hot...

...and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.

Here, Mena is describing how he felt when he stepped onto set for the first time.

The set is the place where a movie is filmed

You could genuinely get lost in the streets.

Genuinely means honestly or 'in a real, sincere way."

That is so sweet!

Yeah.

No, I mean it.

There's so few genuinely nice guys out there.

It can also be used to emphasize something;
like "really", but stronger.

That was genuinely the best cake I have ever had.

It's just so visually stunning.

Stunning is similar to breathtaking.

We use it to refer to something that's very impressive or beautiful.

The hotel room has a stunning view of the city.

Stunning also means extremely attractive.

we use this sense of the word to describe someone's clothes or their physical appearance.

You look absolutely stunning!

Monica, I can't get over how great you look.

You look stunning.

You look incredible too. You're just so fit.

I'm watching the game but I'm not deaf.

From the costumes to the sets,

it was unlike anything I've ever seen.

We can use the prepositions from and to to indicate that there's list of things that make something special.

From the service, to the food, and from the attention to detail to the decoration,

this is genuinely the best restaurant I've ever been to.

"Unlike anything I had ever seen" is a collocation that is used to describe something that is extremely impressive.

The show was "unlike anything we'd ever seen before."

I'm excited to sit in an audience to see it

because everyone really doubled and tripled down on getting it right.

To double down on something means to increase your efforts or determination to achieve something.

I need to double down and focus on studying for tomorrow's exam

The Producers of Aladdin doubled down on making this movie as impressive as possible.

Will also exaggerates this by saying they tripled down.

And, to get it right means, in a broad sense, to do something well.

In the specific case of this movie, to get it right they made everything as real and impressive as

possible and they achieved that by putting a lot of effort into the costumes, the sets,

shooting it in a real desert location in Jordan,

and they also had cultural advisors to represent Arab culture as closely as possible.

In the following clip from the Jimmy kimmel Live,

Will Smith describes some of his experience playing the Genie.

I was terrified getting that first call, you know?

'Cause, you know, as a performer, you want to go, you want to do things,

I just heard you were talking about the "All in the family," you know.

And it's like when you go into something that someone has already

really given an iconic performance, it can be scary,

you know, so I was thinking about that, with the Robin Williams'.

Yes, there's no topping Robin Williams. 
-Oh, yeah, right.

He didn't leave a lot of room to, like, take it up a notch.

But, boy, you did a great job. You really did.

And people will see that. I'm not just saying,

Thank you very much 

Thank you

A performer is a person who entertains people by acting, singing, dancing, or playing music.

While many people in Hollywood are actors, such a title would do little justice to Will

because he has countless skills, such as dancing, singing, rapping, comedy and more.

Here, Will uses the expression "to go into something" with the meaning of to get involved in something.

*: I went into music when I came to the realization that an office job made me miserable.

Will describes Robin William's performance

giving voice to the animated version of the Genie as iconic.

Something that's considered iconic is excellent and admired by many people.

In Bohemian Rhapsody, they did a great job of recreating

the iconic performance by Freddie Mercury at Live Aid.

Top is used as a verb here, and it means to do something better.

Michael Phelps won 15 gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

I wonder if anyone will ever be able to top that.

Top is used as a verb here, and it means to do something better.

There's no topping this bakery's red velvet cake.

Room for improvement is a common, polite collocation that is used to say that something is not perfect and can be improved.

The teacher told me that my daughter's English grades aren't bad,

but that there's still room for improvement.

Finally, to take it up a notch means to make something that's already good, even better.

Of course, Will is saying that Robin Williams' performance did not leave room for improvement (or, in other words, it was perfect),

and therefore it would be a real challenge for him to improve it.

I tell you what,

Let's kick it up a notch.

But, listen, what do you say we, uh...

...crank it up a notch?
