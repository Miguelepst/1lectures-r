Transcript

gentlemen my lady you will always remember  this is the day that you almost C Captain Jack

SP now will you shoot him open

fire a yeah are you ready to learn English  with one of the best adventure movies of all  

time in today's lesson we'll follow Jack  Sparrow and Will Turner while they tried  

to steal a ship from the British royal Navy  this will be a great opportunity for you to  

learn some specific nautical vocabulary in  English that is words about navigation and  

sailing as you probably already know  this is one of the great things about  

learning English with different movies and  series they give you all sorts of real life  

situations that can be useful in gaining  English fluency so are you ready let's Dive

In

this is either Madness or Brilliance it's  remarkable how often those two TR come

inside

everyone stay calm we are  taking over the ship I of

us this ship cannot be crewed by  two men you'll never make it out  

of the bay son I'm Captain Jack Sparrow savy

this is either Madness or brains if somebody says  that something is madness they mean that it's too  

dangerous or stupid to be done the rest of  you will be tried and punished accordingly  

what are you doing Z this is madness what  I should have done years ago more literally  

Madness refers to the state of being mentally ill  especially severely Brilliance is the quality of  

somebody or something that is brilliant to  be brilliant is to have great intelligence  

or skill only a person who wanted to find the  stone find it but not use it would be able to  

get it that is one of my more brilliant  ideas will means that their idea of going  

under water to steal the ship is either very  stupid or intelligent this is either Madness  

or brains so the word either is used here  as a way to refer to one choice between two

possibilities there's only one way  this ends cow either you you die or I

do this is either Madness or Brains it's  remarkable how often those two traits Co  

inside something considered remarkable is unusual  special interesting or excellent if you take this  

word literally you can figure out more of its  meaning remarkable things make you want to make  

a remark about them they get you talking because  they're so special or good getting a be on a test  

isn't remarkable unless you usually get D's  getting to meet the president would be pretty  

remarkable this word is usually safe for things  that are truly exceptional remarkable feat don't  

you think to enter Hogwart Castle on one's own  completely undetected quite remarkable yeah a  

trait is a particular characteristic attribute  or quality that something or somebody has for  

example the labrador dog breed is known to  be very social and familyfriendly these are  

Labrador traits or if a soccer player can run  incredibly fast we say that speed is one of  

his traits it's remarkable how often those  two traits coincide often means frequently  

for example if you see your friends every day you  see each other often so Jack is saying that it's  

really interesting how frequently Madness and  Brilliance happen at the same time that is they

coincide

everyone stay calm we're taking over the ship  to take over is to assume or take control of  

something in this case it also implies the action  of taking control of something without having the  

authority to do so and possibly with Force deck  Cutler Becket has the heart of Davy Jones he  

controls the Flying Dutchman he's taking over  the seas a ship is a large boat like this one  

while boat is a more General word that can  refer to watercraft of different sizes we  

only call ships the larger ones like the one  seen in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies  

other ways to call different types of boats and  water vehicles are vessel cruise and Ferry ship  

is also a verb meaning to transport Goods when  you buy something online the item can be shipped  

to you on a ship but it can also be shipped on a  truck or a train for example everyone stay calm  

we are taking over the ship I of us as you know  in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies we can  

hear many different Expressions about sailing but  an even more unique and iconic type of vocabulary  

that can also be heard are the words associated  with pirates in formally known as pirate English  

which comes mostly from old British and  Scottish English I is another way to say  

yes will you sail to the ends of the Earth and  Beyond to fetch back wited Jack and impress us

p i i

i yes a vast means stop normally used as a  command to give somebody the order to stop I of

B this ship cannot be crewed by two men a crew  is an organized group of workers for example  

a crew might keep a ship sailing smoothly or  build a house in an organized way either way  

crew implies cooperation amongst workers as a  verb if you crew a boat you become part of the  

workers helping to sail it and what makes you  think you're worthy to Crew The Black Pearl  

truth be told I never s to die life in this  scene the official means that the ship needs  

more than two people in the crew it cannot be  crewed by two men this ship cannot be crewed by  

two men you'll never make it out of the bay a  bay is an area of water surrounded by land on  

three sides with one way out to the ocean to  make it is to accomplish something to do it  

successfully for example in reaching a place  going somewhere attending an event or arriving  

on time for something example I can't make  it to the concert I have to work it can also  

imply the idea of surviving or continuing  to exist after going through a difficult

situation would never made it of course

not in the scene the official means that will and  Jack will certainly not have success sailing the  

ship or even even trying to leave the bay you'll  never make it out of the bay with this one line  

you can learn a lot about connected speech and  pronunciation in English let's listen to it  

again closely you'll never make it out of the  bay you'll never make it out of the bay first  

you will notice he connects the words make and  it together resulting in one simple sound make  

it this happens because the word make ends in  a k sound most of the words ending with the  

letter E in English have have it as a silente  you should not pronounce it for example save  

pirate male you will also notice he connects  the phrase of verb make it with the word out  

while making use of the tap t sound make it  out also note that he applies the tap t to  

the letter T in the word out as well you'll never  make it out of the bay finally we can hear a word  

that is commonly mispronounced by Learners the  function word of many Learners will actually  

make the mistake of pronouncing the sound of  the letter F in reality what should be said  

is the sound of the letter v v of now that we  learned how to correctly pronounce the entire  

sentence let's practice you'll never make it  out of the bay you'll never make it out of the

bay you'll never make it out of the bay here  are some other examples of these sounds with  

the TV serious friends you know I have to  find a job where I carry a smaller table or  

a job where you don't have to carry a table you  mean like a doctor you mean like the doctor now  

don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin  can don't you hate it when you have to cut a  

tin can she doesn't know which one of us she  wants me or this Colin guy she doesn't know  

which one of us she wants I can fix up the van  bolt a table in the back and you know what I've

now this word is associated with knowledge  and understanding and nowadays it is more  

commonly used for example to Define  somebody who has a good understanding  

or knowledge about a practical subject so for  example if somebody has a lot of experience  

with business and corporate operations you  could call this person business savvy you  

might also include on your CV V that you are  computer savvy meaning that you are good with

technology come

shiping The Da rash Turner too rash that is  without doubt the worst pirate I have ever

seen here they

now thank you Commodore for getting us ready  to make way we've had a hard time of it by

ourselves s top cells and clear up this  mess with the window quarter a Stern we  

won't catch them I don't need to catch them  just get them in range of the long nines help

bottom of the ocean than in the hands of  a pirate Comm door is disabled the rudder

chainer abandon sh

that's got to be the best part  I've ever seen so it would

seem

Comm they're taking the ship sparrow  they're taking the da in activities  

involving sailing it is common to give boats  and ships names in this scene Jack and Will  

are apparently trying to steal The Dauntless  ship the word dauntless is an adjective that  

refers to showing determination and bravery  that has no fear example the soldiers showed  

dauntless courage in the war more common  is the adjective daunting which means  

that something seems very difficult or int  intimidating example learning English is a  

daunting task but that doesn't mean it has  to be boring Commodore is a title given to  

a naal officer that is a military Authority  at CA who ranks above a captain and Below an

admiral turn Da rash Turner too rash we say that  something is rash when it's done impulsively  

without careful consideration of the possible  consequences of the action example getting  

married so quickly was a rash decision bring  her around bring her around although this is  

not common in English in sailing it's also common  to informally refer to a ship as a she addressing  

it as a female instead of as an object it start  every cabin every hole down to the building here  

Commodore Norrington is referring to three  different types of areas in a ship the cabins  

are the rooms where people normally spend time or  sleep gold refers to the space in which goods are  

carried The Villages are the bottom inside part of  a ship where dirty water collects oh yeah so every  

week we help luners like you understand fast  speaking natives without getting lost without  

missing the jokes and without subtitles just  like BAGI who says that thanks to our videos  

he went from intermediate to advanced level  and now he can understand natives in Canada  

where he's living now you can take your English  to the next level too all you have to do is hit  

that subscribe button and the sell down  below so you don't miss any of our new

lessons sailor back to the Interceptor now a  sailor is someone who works on a boat or ship  

and follows the orders of an official or Commander  Interceptor is the name of the other ship in the  

scene which Jack and Will are now stealing instead  the verb to intercept is to stop something from  

reaching its destination for example example in  American football when you intercept a pass you  

grab the ball that your opponent had thrown to  a member of his own team or in a more practical  

example if you're planning a surprise party for  your friend and she arrives half an hour early  

you might run to intercept her while everyone  else hides to surpriser in the movie the ship  

is probably called Interceptor because of  its speed and ability to catch up to other

ships thank you color for getting  us ready to make way to make way  

for somebody or something normally  means to allow space for someone else  

or something to pass what's going  on here come on might way might

way thank you cidor for getting us ready to  make way however in this scene to make way  

is a nautical term referring to make progress or  travel this is a very unusual use of this phras  

a verb we've had a hard time of it by ourselves  if you have a hard time doing something it is a  

period of difficulty for you it is not easy see  that's why I did so bad on this test I'm having  

a hard time concentrating Jack is jokingly telling  Commodore Norrington that will and him would have  

had difficulty leaving by themselves that is  alone we had a whole time of it by ourselves  

this sentence gives a good example of the third  conditional in English conditional SES in English  

are normally formed by two parts of a sentence  the main clause and the conditional Clause let's  

Analyze This example if you had helped me I would  have passed the test the third conditional tense  

seen above talks about the past it's used to  describe a situation that did not happen and  

to imagine the result of this situation so in this  case you did not help me but if you had helped me  

I would have passed the test now let's analyze  this sentence said by by Jack Sparrow we would  

have had a hard time of it by ourselves as you  might have noticed this sentence contains only the  

conditional Clause it only informs of the possible  result of the situation his previous line was  

actually the one that served as the main Clause  thank you Commodore for getting us ready to make

way we've had a hard time of it by ourselves  so he's basically saying that if commodor  

Norrington had not helped them they would have  had a hard time to travel stop yelling all I'm  

saying is if you had told me vegetarian  lasagna I would have made vegetarian

lasagna H we have to move if we had lost  we would have made them get rid of the

bird no do you want to learn more about  conditionals in English check out this other  

lesson we did with the TV series friends after  you finished learning with this one set top Sals  

and clear up this mess a sail is a big piece of  material attached to a sailboat that catches wind  

and helps it move through the water top Sails are  the sails located on top of the larger main sails  

to set sail refers to the action of opening the  sail so the ship starts moving and traveling by  

saying clear up this mess Commodore Norrington  is informally telling the other official to fix  

the problem they've created with the wind  quter St we won't catch them I don't need  

to catch them just get them in range of the long  nines quarter a Stern are very specific nautical  

terms that refer to the direction from which the  wind is coming and hitting the ship long nines is  

an informal way to refer to Naval long guns or  cannons such as these used for firing at other  

ships and buildings catch I don't need to catch  them just get them in range of the long Nines  

in this case range refers to a distance in which  you can still reach your target for example this  

radar has great range it can detect other ships  more than 200 miles away the Commodore is saying  

that he doesn't intend to catch will and Jack  stolin ship he just wants to position his ship  

in range to fire at them come about run out the  guns come about is a sailing term that means to  

change direction the long guns on these old ships  were mounted on wooden structures with wheels to  

help them move move them around by saying run out  the guns the official is ordering the crew to move  

the guns and point them out in position to fire  we have to find our own ships huh sir is a noun  

used as a formal and very polite way of speaking  to a man especially one who you are providing a  

service to or who is in a position of Authority  or older than you so for example a waiter at a  

restaurant might call a male customer sir or as  in the case of this scene the official calls his  

Superior the Commodore sir many Learners overuse  this word however in the United States this word  

is rarely used by native speakers outside of  these cases I'd rather see her at the bottom  

of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate I would  rather or I'd rather is a phrase used for saying  

that you would prefer to do something or that you  would prefer that something happened example I'd  

rather you didn't mention this matter to anyone  else he doesn't want to go out he'd rather stay  

at home and play video games Loki for all his  grave imbalance understood rulers I know I never  

will I'd rather be a good man than a great king  commodor Norrington is saying that he would rather  

destroy and sink his own ship that got stolen the  Interceptor than leaving it with the pirate Jack  

Sparrow come door he disabled the rudder chainer  the rudder is a flat piece of wood or metal at  

the back of the boat or aircraft like this that  is moved from side to side in order to control  

the direction of the vehicle in the water or air  check out this example of the word from another  

nautical movie Titanic 26 years of experience  working against him he figures anything big enough  

to syn the ship they're going to see in time to  turn the ship's too big with too small a Rudder  

doesn't corner with a damn everything he knows  is wrong hey and if you're enjoying this lesson  

with Pirates of the Caribbean then I bet you'll  really love our lesson that we did recently with  

Titanic you can find that by clicking up here  the rudder chains connect the steering wheel to  

the rudder in the scene the Sailor informs that  Jack has disabled the rudder chain if you disable  

something you turn it off or make it unable  to work properly commor is disabled the rudder
