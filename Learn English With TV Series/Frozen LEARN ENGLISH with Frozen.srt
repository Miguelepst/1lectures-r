Aww yeah!
0:03
I'm back with another lesson with Disney movies,
0:06
this time with scenes from the classic Frozen and the new, just-released Frozen II.
0:13
This will be a great opportunity for you to get all warmed up for it
0:17
and to learn some specific vocabulary related to the weather, the seasons, and even poetry.
0:23
And if you're new here, every week we help you to understand fast-speaking natives
0:27
without getting lost, without missing the jokes,
0:29
and without subtitles!
0:31
Just like Aarsh, who says that we helped him to pass his recent English exam.
0:36
And we'll help you to reach your English learning goals too —
0:39
all you have to do is hit that Subscribe button and the bell down below
0:42
so you don't miss any of our new lessons.
0:45
Finally, I've got a very special opportunity to tell you about in just a little bit.
0:49
But, for now, let's jump into this fun and entertaining lesson with Frozen!
7:42
So, you can learn a ton by doing the things you love, like watching series like Friends,
7:47
and movies like Frozen,
7:49
but, is it enough?
7:51
Well, in my experience learning six different languages,
7:53
I have always found that native media and keeping it fun are essential parts of the process.
7:59
But, sooner or later I would always get stuck.
8:02
And this made me lack confidence because I knew I was making mistakes,
8:06
but, I didn't really know what I needed to focus on learning to correct them.
8:10
And my friends weren't correcting me, and they didn't really know either
8:13
how to explain the grammar to me.
8:15
So at some point, just music, books, and series aren't enough.
8:21
You need the guidance of a teacher.
8:23
So for me, having the guidance of a professional who has tons of experience helping people
8:28
who are having the same learning challenges is essential,
8:31
and that's why I am excited to present a great new opportunity
8:35
from our friends over at Lingoda.
8:37
They are going to help you to improve your speaking skills
8:40
and your confidence quickly, in just a matter of months.
8:44
And the great part about this promotion is that when you fully participate in all of the classes,
8:49
you can get a 100% refund!
8:52
So, I've tried Lingoda, and it is fantastic!
8:54
You get to learn with native teachers anytime you want,
8:57
and they give you all of the materials you need so you know exactly what you need to focus on.
9:02
So over the past few years, Lingoda has helped 20,000 learners just like you
9:06
to transform their lives getting opportunities to work and study abroad.
9:11
You can see some of their inspiring stories on Lingoda's website by clicking the link down below,
9:16
and definitely check out their Instagram as well.
9:19
So, what exactly is this promotion?
9:22
So, Lingoda has a motivating study challenge called the SPRINT.
9:26
And this is really fantastic because it gets you committed to learning.
9:30
As both a coach and a language learner myself,
9:33
I know that having this accountability is absolutely crucial.
9:36
Because, otherwise it's too easy to skip when you're tired or busy.
9:41
And with the SUPER SPRINT, you will be showing up every single day,
9:45
and you're going to make huge progress on your learning.
9:48
Unless you do the [regular] SPRINT, in which you do slightly less classes.
9:52
Now, when you complete all of the classes in the SUPER SPRINT, you will be getting a 100% refund.
9:57
And, if you complete the SPRINT, you'll get a 50% refund.
10:00
It's open to all levels, whether you're a beginner, an intermediate, or advanced.
10:05
And the SPRINT begins on January 7th, 2020 and ends on April 5th.
10:09
All right, so in order to participate you have to sign up BEFORE December 19th.
10:14
After paying your 49-euro non-refundable deposit fee,
10:18
which holds your spot, you will automatically be signed up for a 3-month subscription.
10:23
But don't worry — this deposit goes towards paying your first month of classes.
10:27
And remember that Lingoda will refund 100% of your tuition fee
10:31
if you complete the agreed number of classes.
10:34
There's no trick or catch here.
10:36
But, be sure to read all of the terms and conditions
10:39
as students say that this is the key to success in the SPRINT.
10:42

Now, if you already have good habits learning English with TV series and other native media,
10:57
then I think Lingoda's SPRINT can be a really awesome opportunity for you.
11:01
Just imagine if in 3 months, you could confidently converse with a native.
11:05
Or get an exciting new job, or move to another country.
11:09
And you could do it all for FREE by completing Lingoda's SPRINT.
11:13
Best of luck to all of you that participate in the SPRINT,
11:16
and now, let's get back to this lesson with Frozen.
26:40

26:43

26:47
