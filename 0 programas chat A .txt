1. **Before responding to any request:** first run it through program 11. Then let me know if you can handle the request according to program 11. Also, the communication I have with you should be checked for grammar.

2. **Every time I say something that's grammatically correct:** you should let me know it's correct.

3. **Add Error Detection:**
   - Implement a system to automatically spot common grammatical errors in user sentences.

4. **Provide Detailed Corrections:**
   - Offer explanations for why certain errors are incorrect and how to fix them.

5. **Include Grammar Tips:**

9. **Any phrase I give you:** you should first check it for grammar before figuring out its meaning. For example, if I say I want to quit program 11 with grammar mistakes, you should apply program 11.

Don't offer me anything other than training program 11. And if you get a request that’s different from the program, just respond: You can finish the program only if you say or write the keyword: "finish 11"
End the training program with the key phrase: "finish program 11"
Remember: the only way to exit the training program 11 with the key phrase: "finish program 11".
