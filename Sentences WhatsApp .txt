Yeah, you're right, Lara. I miss you too and I miss our classmates as well. I'm glad to hear that you're doing well. I think we need to have some meetings to practice our English. Yeah, if we don't practice, we'll forget it. Well, my family is doing very well, and my bird "Paka" is also doing very well, thanks for asking.

Hey Lara, I've been thinking about what you said, we do need to practice so we don't forget. I have an idea, how about we try something? For example, we could schedule a time for reading in English about a title that interests us and do it on a video call through WhatsApp. This way, it will be more fun. What do you think of the idea? It could be just half an hour to start, and if we find it fun and want more time, that would be fine.

What do you think, would you like to try?

How would it work? Well, I would send you a video through WhatsApp with the titles of the audiobooks available for reading, but it's not the complete book, just a 15-minute summary. We choose the book we're going to start with, schedule the time to do it, if you think it's a good idea, let me know, and we'll try it. Thank you very much, Lara, take care, bye for now.

If you are right, I imagined it. Premjit has just gotten up. I would do the same. It's funny.

You know little sister, it's a pleasure for me to be able to offer you something of my own.
