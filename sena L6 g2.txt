2. Our Mission!!!,

Present perfect is a verb tense used to talk about actions or events that started in the past and continue into the present or have just been completed. It is formed by using the present tense of the verb "to have" (have/has) and adding the past participle of the main verb. For example, in the sentence "I have eaten lunch," "have eaten" is in the present perfect tense. This tense is often used to express experiences, changes, or actions that have an effect on the present.

Greetings, as I have been living in a very touristy city, "Cartagena de Indias." This year, in August, for my birthday, we have taken a boat trip to the Rosario Islands. We have visited the aquarium, seen the sharks, and my two children have played with the dolphins. The fun has lasted about 8 hours. My wife has been very excited that morning, and she has truly surprised me a day before my birthday. I haven't expected such a gift. In the evening, we have gone to a very elegant restaurant. It has been wonderful to share this experience with my family.

In 1912, my activity had been providing service. I remember that during that time, there had been several incidents that left a lasting impression on me. Nowadays, I cherish those memories as beautiful life anecdotes. The one I remember the most is when, during a city celebration, a group of people had been dancing down the street where I worked. It reminded me of my days in Barranquilla. There was a girl who had come into my establishment dancing, and my friends had encouraged me to dance with her. It was during that dance that I had met my wife; it had been love at first sight and first dance :-). Since that day, we have continued our journey, and now we have two beautiful children.

I have been using my free time to study vocal technique in music. I know I have a beautiful voice waiting to be discovered. I haven't fully found it yet, but I know it's there, so I have kept going. I have been continuing to train every day with vocalization exercises and music.

Singing has been a wonderful experience for me. I remember an early experience with singing in the world of music. It was at a birthday party with many relatives and both close and distant friends. My sister's husband and my niece, Alexandra, had hired a mariachi band.

Everything was going well with the mariachis until I asked the band to let me sing a song. Everyone liked the idea, and they made me out to be a famous singer who had arrived at the party a little late due to a flight delay.

I sang the song very well, and I have reliable witnesses who can confirm that. However, I was somewhat comfortable and a bit shy while singing. I thought of ending the song with a very high note in the style of Luciano Pavarotti, which was a bad idea, but in the end, it has turned out to be quite entertaining. We have all had a lot of fun, and I have even laughed at myself because I went off-key so horribly.

Now my question in this video is this:
What would you like to tell me about yourself?

So leave your answers below this video
And remember, you are the best of the best.

Thank for watching, and See you next time. :-)
