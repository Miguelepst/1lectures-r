Patriot, no, no, no, Patriot, it's you know, like veteran, yeah, V, yeah, but you know, it's not a Federal holiday in all of the states, it was only in Massachusetts, it wasn't in all over the states, only for Massachusetts, but this holiday like for veterans holiday it's mostly in November, 11 of November, yeah, you know, in all over the world, so in all over the states it's a Federal holiday, but this one it was only for Massachusetts, yeah, yeah, it was also the T day and the Boston's Marathon, yeah, yeah, so it was pretty because there was the Boston Marathon, so it was a lot like they Clos a lot of the streets and there was a lot of people running, um, yeah, but um, I don't run, but yeah, there were a lot of people running on the marathon, um, yeah, it's it was once in Boston it's mostly once a year they have Marathon, this is was once once a year, but it's good, you know, to run for Marathon, uh, teacher please can you explain us H how is they celebrate for that, um, the celebration well they don't really do anything, they just basically it's like a Sunday but on the they close uh some of the streets uh and the Avenues so that people can go and run and so they have to run a lot of miles, um, okay, and yeah, 42.6 miles, 42.6 miles, that's a lot, quite long way, do you prove it before Maria, uh, no, I, I didn't do but I did you prove this Marathon, no, no, no this no no but what I know what I count to do you know I live in New York so in New York it's also we have Marathon but you cannot take uh to uh to be in Marathon to take you know to be a member or how you call it you know uh why because first of all you you should pay money if you won run it's firstly secondly you should make training two times a make it's half of marathon it means 20 it means um half of marathon, yeah, few times a week, it's not everyone who wants to run he is running no yes no this is very organized but it's very good it doesn't mean you should do this uh to to give to have some price for it no they get start in the morning to the evening so you take your time and you run with people it's very good companion uh sheep you know it's very good for the people do they get do they get any benefits from that or not uh yes yes what does it benefit no why people are running for instance in different states they make Marathon people running and they uh running for to to found money money yes so afterwards this money going for some social in some social places you know to help people donation maybe donation something like that donation donation donation that why people are running yeah it's minimum it's $110,000.

you get price so all your money you give to this charity we we say charity but I

so they get a money for it so they get a money from know you guys know but you

donate this money you donate you cannot take it you cannot take him you should

no no no no the principle to because of the because if

you can take it all of us we can go to register for

that Norway also they arrange Marathon each year and

U one year uh our Norwegian English teacher uh is uh what is called is

joining this Maron we support here yeah it's very good I count next

money if if they took I'm can register all my family it's not just me no no no

no no no no you give you time it's like a volunteer it's like a volunteer and

also donation is good too to help other peopel of course obviously joke yes of course than God um I want just to make

you fun guys because you know very interested 10,000 something I know everyone want it don't be like you don't

knowbody want it you know I not agree with you why because some people cannot

run they're lazy they don't like it so even if you will pay them they won't run

you see so it's a part of the character people who's running it's a people

active people you see yes it is so anyway they will run yeah

break like yeah later tell you something you should

change your picture in profile you're so beautiful God bless her M

congratulations God bless you very nice so too much and you forgot our teacher

yes forget the classes right no it's okay no I'm enjoying it glad you guys

are talking like it I'm I'm intrigued um and it's

really interesting that you guys know a lot about that you know yeah okay thank you for a moment there

was a lot going on because everyone was just talking about donations marathon

and then in the chat someone was talking about a dirty

mind suddenly Aisha very beautiful appears you see

okay okay thank yeah when I when I saw youa when I saw you picture like that

it's like a cup of my think was me because we look each other like you

know then I was make sure if it's come my Cera it's off or not then I say was

you yeah yeah I changed thank you yeah yeah I see I see like you I look we look

like each other when you you was without hijab you know

she's she's very beautiful with and without but it's good to change the

picture I no it's okay I agree thank

you um Ali I want to know what's your thought what do you so you said every

day is a holiday believe me if you have a dir mind friend life is more beautiful

way more it true we get enjoyment from simple things we can't even walk 10

kilometers straight when with close friend okay what I'm assuming by your

comment is that every day could be a holiday if you want to like you

shouldn't expect to be the marathon to just run because you could run every

day exactly okay very philosophical approach

to life very philosophical approach to life up to you like if you know how to

enjoy like every second of it look like a holiday every day you know true um

yeah it's pretty much true so the topic that um they gave for me today to talk

to you is about family d

dyamics um this could be a polemic um Topic in a way but at the same time not

really um I want to hear everyone's opinion on it

because yeah sure don't worry because for some people the whole

concept of family is only a blood thing you know um so the people you grew up

with or the people you were born of but family goes further than that I think

that the concept of family is also just people that you feel safe with and just

people that you have a relationship with it could be your friends you know for

example me I don't live with my family here um my family is away but my friends

are my family here you know so family changes

constantly and there are different kind of families you know but today here on

English we're just going to learn a family vocabulary and we're going to make sure we know yeah just a family

vocabulary you know so for example um Maria who do you live

with I live in with the family of my daughter okay my daughter so uh when

children were small young children yeah so it was one kind of family as you said

it's changed all the time when children become uh more adults so they left house

they left house they made their own way uh how to live their life with their

friends with their family whatever and this is changes but you're right What

Remain it's good relationship and friends friends exactly friends become

our family because people who stay with us it's our friends it doesn't matter if

you have long relationship or it's your neighbors you all the time it's changed

all the time you it's changed very Dynamic process very Dynamic process

this is the family it's somebody that can you trust can you

share good moment and bad moment you know in one words it's a friends friends

exactly so I agree all right let me ask to um H now how many siblings do you

have first hi teacher I have two sisters and two brothers

cool so uh so you're in the middle are you the middle one oh no I am the youngest one oh

you're the youngest one yeah just I have I mean like between

the sister but I have a little brother got you well that's that's cool

um let and I want to say something maybe

you wrote my you read my message in bre in um in the chat I think it's better to

go to breakout room and talk you oh yeah um we're going to have breakout rooms um

later we always have like the breakout rooms like almost at the end of the class not at the end but like yeah but

we want we want to more okay um how about at  break a

rooms till 1 55 from what 130 to 155 or you one more

time more time a little bit more yeah so it's easier to speak to some three four

people than to 15 yeah I got you so from

like 12 120 to 155 Good perfect perfect also you mean

only 20 minutes no from what that's 35 minutes more from 120 to 155 yeah

it's good it's good because at  we come back and then we just have the final conversation everyone for five

minutes yeah so okay at 12 120 we'll put to breaker rooms for now that's as um

you know as Carlo said let's just enjoy the conversation um I think better we have

our teacher give us introduction and energize us before we go and uh speak

there exactly that's my point do not hesitate uh this common uh teacher

introduction do not hesitate and just we are running to what is called this

room learn more yes thanks me exactly because I love when you guys talk but

first I need to give as small introduction of the topic and first I need to talk a little bit with you guys

and then you guys can go in break at Rooms and talk um but yeah not don't worry only give us a question to the uh

husband is Aunt but the cousin's husband is not

cousin or cousin husband wife is not wait that's a little crazy way word

you know what I mean it's yes because you know because you know cousin it's

somebody who belongs to family and his wife it doesn't belong to families why

because wife or cousin uncle's wife also doesn't belong to family uncle one each

one who comes new to family it's not family that's it but but they call

uncle's wife on yeah yeah I don't know it really depends

on the person that's like crazy um that's

don't I don't I like I don't mind I was just like just wondering um no it's fine

I love jokes I just don't don't I just want I just want to know you know but

okay before we go into breaker rooms you know I like you guys to read so I'm

going to start here and then we'll do a couple paragraphs so

um role plays um roles play an extremely important part in healthy family

functioning most researchers agree that the establishment of clear roles within

a family is directly connected to a family's ability to deal with daytoday

life un forcing crisis and the normal changes that occur in families over time

yeah basically someone you leave to dayto day someone that's there for you

in crisis that you don't expect and with different change that happens in life

and family all right so who wants to read on

like the blue part Mar yeah types of

family roles family roles are the recurrent uh parents of behavior by

which individual fulfilled family functions

and needs uh a needs yeah okay

okay um individual members of family occupy certain roles such as child

siblings grandchild along with roles uh

come certain social and family expectations uh for how those role

should be fulfilled thank you now the next person that looks here it's Miguel Miguel you

can read this

f

yeah

yes yes yeah thank you I was just going to say so this word you can pronounce it as

expect did um not it's just speed with a little

D and then here it's spanding

um it's backed it's backed

and it's spanding yeah thank you all right I see um you can go to here

okay instrumental and effective roles individuals within a family have both

instrumental and effective roles to fulfill each serves an important

function in maintaining healthy family functioning instrumental roles are

concerned with provision of physical resources um I always forgot how do you

pronounce I just say it sample oh for example Le okay thank you food clothing

and shelter decision making and Family Management effective roles exist to

provide emotional support and encouragement to family members both set

of rules uh must be present for healthy family functioning in addition families

must also consider issues of roles allocation and

accountability thank you all right um Carlos we're going to start here and

once you finish this uh we'll just finish here okay so let's

start can you hear me yeah yes okay five

essential roles for Effective family functioning there are many roles within

a family however researchers have identified the following five roles as

being Essentials for a healthy family

provisions of resources providing resources such as money food clothing

and shelter for all family members is one of the most basic yet important

roles within a family this is primarily an instrumental role perfect thank you

uh now Sara you can read

this this one oh nutrients and support nutrients and

supporting other family members is primary an effective role

including Pro proving confence warming and resource for family

members example for this role are are app parent

comfortable a child after he she has a bad day at school or family members

support one others after the dead of a loved ones

thank you um would you mind trying to spell this

comforting comforting cool perfect and

supporting supporting perfect thank you now sa you can read

this life skill development the life of skills development role includes the physical

emotional educational and Social Development of children and adults

examples of this role are a parent helping a child make it through school

or a parent helping a young adult

child decide on a career path thank

you uh you can read this thank you maintenance and management of the family

system this Force role involves many tasks including leadership decision

making handling family Finance finances and maintaining appropriate uh roles

with respect to Extended family friends and neighbors other responsibilities of

this role include maintaining discipline and enforcing behavioral

standards thank you

um gratification of Marshal Partners a satisfy sexual relationship is one of

the keys to equality marital relationship this rule involves meeting

sexual needs in a manner that is satisfying to B

spes thank you and then we have reproduction and all the things that come along with that um so that's like

oldest one when I see them uh I don't have so much to share

with but you can see them because they are living in the same place in which

holidays yeah we meet each other but the youngest ones um when I meet I talk like

a friend we share a lot the youngest one I'm close MH mhm yeah good uh you want

to spin till he will come back no I cannot

because he should spin but I can read the next question because I've also

opened uh in my own phone okay if you want uh but I cannot do this spin I

don't know why yeah can you spin yeah because I don't know why but I

don't yeah okay like this what's the

question uh are there any rules in your

family what are there do you think they're Fair okay um in my family um it was like

traditional it's not something written rules you see but it was by example from

the parents and grandparents it was an example so children grew up not with the

some band and rules but we saw example and today I can see only by this that I

saw I continue the same way as was um my

grandma was my M did Mom did and I suppose that my children will continue

the same way because I was an example for them even I didn't ask it wasn't

some rules you know like you should do like this or like that what in your

uh Miguel

can I ask you does she listen to this rules

good girl good

girl okay okay uh sa it's your

turn yeah yeah it's your turn Okay uh

like I can say the family rule my family actually is a

traditional family and um so we we have

to respect older ones in the family and in relative and what does it mean we have H

you saw as your mom respect yes so this is an example yeah yeah for example

everyone should you know El older ones have more respect

like you should be respectful to older ones

yes yeah okay so uh traditional

ping yeah I sometimes I think it is fair but sometimes actually I think it is not

fair because I think respect is something Mutual in my opinion but um

yeah what uh you should earn this yes you should earn this you should work for

this yeah it's doesn't from Sky yeah yeah but some people like some um people

believe that U as they are older so uh they should be respected whatever they

do and whatever they say you know yes yes so it is it is tough but the family

Rules want us to still respect them so it is difficult yes it's difficult yes

yes um uh spin it spin it

uh yeah we

Who ah I I didn't see

her no it's only only three of us only three of us was she joined us late I

think yeah okay spin it why I can't spin it I don't know okay

that's it is her it is his actually ah okay okay okay okay do you have any family living

or working abroad talk about them yes I have um two sisters and one elderly and

one uh uh small than me and they are

living abroad they don't live with myself in place in which I live so um

this is my case now

uh about you Miguel

m m okay

okay yeah I have two cousins who live abroad one of them um lives in Australia

with her husband and she works there and in she

is a PhD holder and she works in University and the other one lives in

the UK with her husband and recently she born she gave birth to a

baby and do you have contact with her or only by WhatsApp yeah she came ah he

came for the new year and we saw his son

very cute baby you spin

it I don't know I can't see

her

yeah his family important to you explain why yeah for me it's important why

because I grew up in family so my perception of life it's family you see

person want what they knew before because if you don't know something you

don't want it but I grew up in family

before it was very traditional it was it's a strong uh relationship between um

like sa said elderly people like Grandma she was like a um you know rock in

family so very clever so for me it's very important it's very important I

suppose for my children it will be a little bit different I don't know because from generation to

generation things changed you see things changed but for me

yes and

Miguel yes yes yes yes yes SE it's your

turn yeah for me family is uh very important and

uh I agree with what you guys said uh because we we was born and nurtured by

the family and uh the personality everything shaped in the family yes and

uh I feel deep uh love to my family family MH um but sometimes I don't

actually get along with my sisters doesn't matter doesn't matter

doesn't matter in all of the cases wehs ups and downs doesn't matter but what's

important it's you know how you grew up I grew up in family that why it's so

important for me because it's my experience in life this one made my

perception of the life family you see but some people I don't know I cannot

speak for somebody else yes but in place in my place it was like

this okay skip it spin it spin

it no we told we we spoke about it you know you Miguel if

you in instead of resume you you

can uh press eliminate button

and yeah

okay I can take my sisters one of them elderly sister because I saw her a i

closer to her much closer than to my smallest sister you see pick up one of
