Hi we just finish meeting for intonation practice on August 14th
and we started with a video,
this is a scene from the movie The Pink Panther
where, uh, Steve Martin is using, a accent coach,
to help him sound American,
when he says: "I would like to buy a hamburger"
and, um, not making fun of any French accent
is just a, an interesting funny way to um,
I don't know, joke about trying to change your accent
um, but it is funny,
he has fun with it
and I thought you might like it
so, how, how'd you manage to finish so quickly
I'm going to make the U change to Y
and the D connect to the Y how
and then the important words, the question word
how manage
and the adverb quickly so
how'd you manage to finish so quickly
how'd you manage to finish so quickly
how'd you manage to finish so quickly
I can't believe it
they're going to
I'm going to change "going to" to gonna
they're going to
they're gonna see if they can fix it before the meeting
they're going to (gonna) see if they can
.
+30 MP (minutes practica)
.
and remember you didn't hear me say can't
it's can
so, just make a k and N very quickly
if you hear the vowel can
it will sound like the negative can't can't
but they can fix it
they're going to see if they can fix it before the meeting
you should have
and this should have
is an example of uh the V changing to just uh
shoulda
you should've seen how fast she was running
you should've seen how fast she was running
you should've seen how fast she was running
and this combination STS ("fa-st" "s-he")
is when you could stop the air flow to make the T "how fast she"
and you definitely don't need to make a good T
fast she but fast she or you can just skip the T
how fast she was running
and now it'll kind of make a sh, you know
fast she, how fast she
uh and that's what I did
I'm, either holding the T
or getting rid of the T
um you should have
you should have seen how fast she was running
A noisy gong or a clanging symbol
A noisy gong or
there's kind of a connection between gong or a clanging symbol
A noisy gong or a clanging symbol
and this is another anging
we had a lot yesterday
clang
and then slide it back
in
clanging instead of clanging
um, see you later
is what we might write
but it always changes to Y see you later
see you,
if you say see you later
a lot of times I hear people
just say see you
and it's little weird like
I see you
instead of
see you
so the shorten version is just, see you
see you.
uh you can have uh, more perfect I guess
um, it can, it can sound more like what it looks like
if you say
see you all later
and you have to make a good U
and then there'll be an invisible W couse you're going from
a rounded you to an unrounded all
you all
see you all later
hey see you all later
if you want to have, uh, more uh, contraction and push it together
we can make you into (y apostrophe all) y'all
and that sound like a single word y'all
and this is not most General American dialect
this is more common in southern American dialect
so, I try not to say it, but that's just my choice,
I'm kind of right in the middle of the United States
and I can choose which ones I want
so see y'all later, see y'all
it'll,
If you want to think of it as A-H as aw, or A-W as aw, that's fine. See y'all later.
.
- *Start of Part 2: (4:(03) - 8)*
.
If you want to think of it as A-H as aw, or A-W as aw, that's fine. See y'all later.
I coulda sworn I left my keys on the table.
Coulda, instead of could've, it will be easier to just drop the V and say coulda.
sworn I will connect left my, I don't have to say this T at all. I can just say left my, left my keys on.
This will connect the table.
I coulda sworn I left my keys on the table.
I could have sworn I left my keys on the table.
And that's the same meaning, just a different verb tense. If you say,
I swear I left my keys on the table.
I swear I, we'll connect, left my, still no T, keys on the table.
I swear I left my keys on the table.
It is, we'll change to contraction anytime you can make a contraction, do.
It is not irritable and resentful.
So I'm connecting it's, make a contraction, and now it's not.
Really, you only need one S, but I'm connecting it's not.
And hold the T, because you won't hear the T.
It's not, oh, that T changes to a D, I'm sorry.
It's not irritable.
So I'm holding this T because I'm not saying snot,
but it's not irritable.
Now the T in not, that's a D, will connect to the I,
and that's what makes it sound like dear, irritable.
Dear-itable-in. Instead of saying and,
I'm not going to say and at all.
I'm going to make it in.
And that in is kind of a "ih" or an "uh" with just the "in" sound.
So any two things can be reduced to just an "in" in the middle,
like salt and pepper.
I can make it "in" there.
Irritable-in.
So I'm making this irritable-in, because this L connects to the A.
Irritable and resentful.
Don't say the T in resentful. It's not irritable and resentful.
Let's wrap it up and call it a day.
Let's wrap it up, all connects,
and again, instead of saying and, I'm just making it in,
and the P will connect,
so it'll sound like: wrap it up and, wrap it up and,
so easy to Miss:
call it a day.
Call it a day.
Let's wrap it up and call it a day.
That would have been a good one to end on.
I eat pizza once in a blue moon.
I eat pizza once in a blue moon
once in will all connect
and, only lay down true principles and adhere to them inflexibly.
And some words we practice today
symbol, cymbal
that was in the sentence
and symbol as in a sign are exactly the same pronunciation symbol
principles, principals
principles and principals. The humans sound exactly the same principles.
And I always think of this one as the person, the leader of the school because pal is a friend.
So it's a person. So principal principal
And now I'll say them all without chit chat.
How'd you manage to finish so quickly.
How'd you manage to finish so quickly.
They're going to see if they can fix it before the meeting.
You should
How'd you manage to finish so quickly?
How'd you manage to finish so quickly?
They're going to see if they can fix it before the meeting.
You should have seen how fast she was running.
A noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
See you later.
See ya.
See you all later.
See y'all later.
I could have sworn I left my keys on the table.
I swear I left my keys on the table.
It's not irritable and resentful.
Let's wrap it up and call it a day.
I eat pizza once in a blue moon.
Only lay down true principles and adhere to them inflexibly.
All right. Thank you. It's good to see everyone and have a good weekend.
I'll see you next week for pronunciation on Tuesdays and intonation on Wednesdays. Thanks.
