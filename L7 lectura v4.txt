9 ONCE UPON A TIME, in a small village, there lived a young boy who 48 USED TO walk 1 CAREFULLY through the woods 2 SLOWLY searching for wild berries. One day, while picking berries 3 SIMPLY for his family, he heard a sound so 5 LOUDLY that he jumped.

11 SUDDENLY, a small creature appeared before him. It was like nothing he had ever seen 50 I would bet! The creature spoke 4 EASILY to him, "I am lost, can you help me find my home?" The boy nodded 6 SUCCESSFULLY and promised to help.


20 FOR A LONG time, they searched together. 10 MEANWHILE, back at home, the boyâ€™s parents worried because night was falling. 12 LATER, as the stars began to shine, the boy realized they were 7 TOO far from his village.

13 AFTERWARDS, they decided to camp 8 COMPLETELY safe in a cave. 14 WHEN morning came, the boy noticed a path that seemed familiar. 15 FINALLY, they reached a peculiar tree that the creature recognized as home.

16 AT THE END of the journey, the creature thanked the boy and gave him a gift that would make him 32 LUCKY YOU, said the boy with astonishment. 17 BY THE TIME he returned, his parents were overjoyed and 21 I'M NOT SURPRISED, they exclaimed, embracing him.

19 BEFORE he slept that night, the boy thought about his adventure. He realized that the woods were full of wonders 22 YOU'RE JOKING?, his friends would doubt, but he knew better. 23 I CAN IMAGINE! he told himself, knowing he had a story no one else did.

24 WHAT A NIGHTMARE everyone would say if they knew he had been lost, but to him, it was an adventure. 25 SOUNDS AWFUL, but in his heart, he felt brave. 26 SOUNDS TERRIBLE! some might think, yet, he was filled with joy.

27 I DON'T BLAME YOU for feeling scared, his father said, but the boy shook his head. 28 WOW, THAT'S AMAZING! his mother marveled at the gift the creature gave.

29 OH, he thought, realizing how much he had grown. 30 I SEE, he told himself, I am braver than yesterday. 31 WHAT YOU MEAN, asked his friends, is you met a magical creature? Yes, he replied with a smile, 34 SO, 35 WHAT HAPPENED? they pressed on for details.

36 YOU CAN'T BE, his skeptic friend started, 37 SERIOUS , but indeed, 49 indeed he was. 38 JUST imagine, he said back. And the boy recounted his tale once more, 39 ALREADY known to his family, but 40 YET exciting for him to share.

41 STILL, no one believed him, and he laughed it off. He knew 42 FOR AND SINCE that would be his destiny. 43 AGO, he thought, I never would have dreamed of such things. He would always remember it, not as something from 44 YESTERDAY or 45 THE OTHER DAY LAST WEEK, but as an eternal memory.

46 LAST MONTH, he 47 LAST YEAR was just a boy, but now, he was someone who had lived a fairytale. It was a moment in time he would keep 33 OH MY GOD! WERE YOU REALLY? Yes, he was, he was really there. And that is the story of how a simple day turned into the adventure of a lifetime.
