++Person B: Really? I find that hard to believe. 
  I did some research, and it seems like he might be lying about his credentials.

**Teacher: What? No way! Mark has always seemed like the real deal to me. 
           What did you find out?
	   **Teacher: 
	     That's surprising. I've known Mark for years, 
	     and he always seemed trustworthy. 
	     Did you confront him about it?

   	    --Person B: but I Not yet. 
            I wanted to gather more evidence before approaching him. 
            It's possible there's a misunderstanding, 
            but I thought it was important to bring it up.

**Teacher: I agree. 
  If his credentials are indeed false, 
  it could have serious consequences for him. 
  Keep me updated on what you find out.

that's the right move?
