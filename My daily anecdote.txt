Summarized anecdote 1:

In an English class on Zoom, the teacher formed conversation groups at the end of the session. A group of friends, including Linda, Husna, and Ayse, used to stand out for their joy and humor, but sometimes the teacher separated them. Linda and Ayse asked Husna to request the teacher to include them in the same group. However, when the teacher formed the groups, she forgot to include Husna, who had been the only one brave enough to ask her the favor. Despite this, the meeting went on with humor and in the end, Husna, although not very happy, took the situation with humor. Although Husna did not join the group, everyone had fun, and the meeting ended normally.

Original anecdote:
I want to tell you something funny that happened to me yesterday in an English class with some classmates.

In the Zoom virtual class, at the end of the lesson, the teacher forms small conversation groups. There are new students, and there are also students who have been there longer, like me and some other classmates. Well, we have a group of friends that when we get together, what stands out is the joy, the humor, and unfortunately sometimes the teacher doesn't include us in the same group. So, yesterday, Linda asked Husna to do her a favor and tell the teacher to include us in the same group, and Ayse also asked her to please include us. The funny thing about the story was that the teacher formed the group but didn't include Husna, who was the one who finally had the courage to ask the teacher for the favor.

The meeting ended, and Husna wasn't very happy, but in a joking way, she noticed the humor in the situation.

The group was waiting for Husna, but she never arrived, so I called the teacher in the group and told her, "Teacher, we're waiting for Husna in the group," but she informed us that there were only 4 minutes left for the meeting to end, so there was nothing we could do.

We missed Husna in the group, but we still had fun in the group with everything that happened.
