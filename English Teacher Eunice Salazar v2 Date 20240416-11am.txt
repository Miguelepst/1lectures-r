Different perhaps, but it wasn't an Italian restaurant. You know it's good to go to an Italian restaurant when they're experts at it. Yeah, it's kind of dry, isn't it? It is, the thing is because this crust would absorb all the water, you know, all the juice, all this moisture. Yes, yeah, so it's not going to feel the same. Yeah, that's a new thing for me but okay, I'm grateful I was able to buy lasagna, but the lasagna that I didn't like. Okay, well hello, hello, for those who have just joined, we have Miguel, Tom, Lara, Mimon, and Shella. Would you guys turn on your cameras so that we can see each other if you are not busy? There you go, hi Miguel, Ellie, um, Lara is here, hello. What's up Lara? How's life going? I am a little busy now, I can't open my video but I am here, and I can speak. So, what are you busy with? What are you busy with, like, are you busy with studying, house chores? How do you say, like, home, home? No, um, works of my home, how do you say that? You say house chores, house chores, chores, house chores, house chores, yeah, correct. Okay, how do you spell the word chores? C h o r e s, correct, house chores. So when you say house chores, these are the activities, these are the things that we do at home, like, for example, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, okay, those are house chores ever since our mom tells us. Yeah, what we are doing every day, every day, like, do you guys enjoy doing house chores? Because I know people who enjoy doing this, and I know people who, of course, procrastinate doing house chores, what person are you? But these kinds of things make you strong in discipline, yeah, when it becomes a habit, it's even good, you know how to start your day, your day, so yeah, it's good. That's actually right, are you a kind of person who, like, fixes the bed or makes the bed right after you wake up? It's good to make a bed, you know, psychologists say it's very good for your mental health, have you ever seen the movie like American Psycho? I haven't. So how is it? In this movie, there's a man who fixes his bed and every morning, like, fixes it, irons on it, it's really wonderful to, yeah, the man is, like, kind of working at the hotel. Well, I love that, if I have a partner like that, I'm gonna be so happy because, you know, it's very tidy, I like tidy things, but when it comes to me doing the tidiness, I'm gonna say I'm so bad at that, maybe because my schedule is hectic, or maybe because I just don't like it, I just don't like doing it. Well, how about you Tom, how is life going so far? Okay, hey Tom, can you hear me? Hello? Hey, what's up? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you nicely. Okay, what about you? How are you doing so far? I'm doing fine, thank you very much, it's my first time, well, it's actually my second time on your Zoom meetings, and so I'm very glad to see so many people wanting to improve their English skills, and I want to do so myself, so yeah, it's nice to meet you all. That is very lovely, where are you from Tom? I am originally from Canada, but have spent most of my life in Europe. Okay, which country in Europe, especially? Well, I've lived in Spain, I worked in Portugal, in Italy a little bit too, not in France yet, that's where I am at the moment, and trying to work on it. Yeah, so which country would you say is the best, like, European country? Oh, that's a tough one, they, you know, with it's like how would I say hard to decide, I can see your face because it's you get, you get cool stuff in every country, they're very similar in terms of like, you know, when you drive, when you're driving, thanks to the single currency, things tend to look more and more similar in different countries, but then again, you realize that people speak different languages, so it's true, um, I don't know, I couldn't choose, I love France, I couldn't choose, I love France, that's where I am at the moment, perhaps it's because your native language is French, you see? Perhaps, I'm not from Quebec, okay, I got you, well, you know what, I just watched a video, it's a vlog actually, and I feel many people who are doing the grocery in Germany instead, even though they are residing in Switzerland, have you guys seen that? No, can you repeat it? So, people who are living in Switzerland are doing their shopping in Germany because they said that it's pretty cheap, because there's a lot of taxes, yeah, it's much more expensive in Switzerland than in France, you know, they have borders so it's not a big deal to pass a border to buy, especially meat, to return, but problem is Switzerland post taxes on that because you cannot take more than two packages, you see? Or two, yeah, but when you have a big family, what can you do?

Yeah, it's quite strange, very unusual, right? Because you have to cross the border, you literally have to go to another country just to buy your things. Yes, yes, yes. And you have to undergo Customs. At first, I could not believe it. Yeah, but they explain that it's because of the prices, the tax, and even the options because they said that there are many options in Germany than in Switzerland. You know, this is a competitive field, you know, so they compete. This is the problem. Okay, well anyway, let's go on to our topic. Okay, so our topic is not about European city or European country, not about shopping. So we're going to talk about, can you guys remember the topic that we were supposed to discuss? Friendship, relationship, friend. CL friendship, relationship, that's right. Let me just share my screen. So the topic for today is all about friendship and social BS. So in this lesson, we are going to explore the dynamics of friendship and build social connection. We will also learn some new words related to friendship and social ons. Not sure if we can still study about the grammar, but we will try. Oh, here, what is that? This one, which link this presentation? Okay, so what do you want me to do? Do you want me to have a copy of this for every lesson we have? Yes, it's good to repeat afterwards. Okay, but I can only do that right after the lesson. Thank you very much, because if I'm going to give you the topics right now, then it's going to be difficult for me to open a prompt because you already know what I should be saying and should be, you know, know that. So instead of you having my attention, or, you know, no, no, no, I think that's the opposite one. Instead of me getting your attention, that's going to be a little impossible if you got this PDF or presentation. Yeah, but at the end, it will be very efficient. At the end, efficient repeat. So this presentation could be a form of review if you would like to. So you can get a PDF copy of this after our class, and then you can review it since I only do Tuesdays. So you can ask Alejandro to provide Mondays and Wednesdays. All right. Sorry, teacher. Sure. Should we make a presentation this night also? Yeah, as I told you, like to show a picture of your friend, right? Was that the thing that I said last week? Yes, teacher. But I think it's kind of boring. It's kind of boring too for you to like making presentation. Okay, no, no, no. So we're not going to make our own presentation because it's going to take long like what we had last time, and we did not have to converse at all because everybody's like pretty busy with all the task. So I think it's going to be good when we converse about a topic and then do all the task right after we finish. Is good? That's nice. Thank you. So what you are trying to say is that I can review or I can take a look at your work first before you present. Is that it? Of course. Yeah, but I'm not going to assure you that I can take a look at it like one by one. You know how busy my schedule is, right? But I'm trying, but I'm trying. But you can contact me through my email if you would like to talk. I usually reply, but I usually, so I don't always reply, but I try to reply. If you can only see my email, you're going to cry. Of course, yeah, that's going to lovely. Oh, that's going to be lovely. But okay, I'm saying, but I'm so sorry. I know you don't like the but, but I'm going to say, but our time is very limited, darling. It's just an hour and a half. So if I accommodate each and every one of you, it's going to take some time, and some people might feel bad about it because they are waiting. So they would feel that, Oh, teacher is giving more favor to Maria, you know what I mean? Okay, but if you would like to talk, please talk with me, especially during the breakout session. For example, you guys are in the breakout session, but you don't feel like you would like to join there, or you don't feel like your groupmates are not listening with you, then please join me in the main session. I'll talk to you. I'm going to give you advice. I'm going to move you to another room just so I can accommodate your request. Okay, sounds good. Yeah. Okay, I, you know, I just, now Netflix is asking me to pâ€”hello there. I know you are, wow, wow. Hi. Yeah, I'm a different I, so beautiful. So beautiful. You, who are you? So nervous, but I right now I feel okay. Thank you. Oh my goodness, is you really look great. You are beautiful. Oh my God, how are you? I almost can't recognize you. You look so young. Sorry, you look very young with your hair down. Yes, yes, exactly. Like everybody says that is your, you know, big sister or not. I'm going to say yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. Thank you. All right.

Okay, so let's talk about this topic; it's all about friendship and social connections. First question: what are the important qualities in a friend? What qualities should you look for when making connections or friends? Okay, yes, Maria, yes, sure. I think trust is very important. When you make a connection and trust people, you feel very comfortable. And afterward, you need companionship to hang out, to do things with people who like to do the same things. But much more, it's about trust. Has anyone ever broken your trust, Maria? Good question, good question. I'll tell you from my experience. When I grew up in school, we chose people to get close to them intuitively because we didn't have other tools. And afterward, you see it was a good choice, why? Because it's real. Sometimes, in my case, I have had very long companionship with friends for 30 years. So when you pass such a long time, you understand it was true friendship. It doesn't mean you always accept; it doesn't mean you need. But friendship is more about listening, hanging out. Yes, listening is very important, not advising because you cannot advise somebody who needs a shoulder to cry on. What does it mean to be a friend when you feel not good to speak to somebody? So what should somebody do? They should be your psychologist only if we are not psychologists; it's better not to give advice but listen. That's all. And I love that time changed; you do not have to say and you do not have to criticize, only listen. It's enough. That's right. That's actually a good thing. You don't always have to say something; listening is enough, being there, showing up. Yes, by this way, you show that he or she can count on you. It's important for our confidence, support. I can count on my friends. It doesn't mean I ask for something from them, but you know, it's everything in our head. That's lovely. Thank you for that. That's a reminder to not criticize, just be there for your friend, just stand up, listen, open your ears, open your eyes. Thank you for that, Maria; we appreciate that. So let's hear from Miguel. How about you, Miguel? What qualities do you think are important in a friend? You were saying that having no judgment is important. That's right. I think that is what you can call acceptance, you know, just accept what is there without judgment. You listen, you talk less, you be there. That's the best thing you can do. Mhm, I got your point. Thank you for sharing, Miguel. How about you, Aisha? What do you think is the best quality that a friend can have? Friendship, like this topic, is so difficult for me to talk about because I had so many troubles. In one or two years, I lost one of my closest friends. She is not my close friend anymore, but yeah, in friendship, I think empathy comes first. And if you have a good friend or if you are in a good friendship, you have to, like Maria said, listen to that person, and trust also. This is a big issue for me. And you have to also respect the other person. Sometimes, we make mistakes, like Miguel said, and we can cross the line without knowing. If you don't know that person so much, you can cross easily. So we have to take care about these situations, like those rules. Very good vocabulary, Aisha, crossing the line, and also, what is that word you mentioned? I just forgot the word, but yeah, crossing the border, that is right. So there should be a limitation. You just, friends, our personal lives that are private, you know, you keep it to yourself. If your friend tells you something, you just do not criticize or jump to giving comments or say something. Sometimes, I get too nosy, you know me, I'm so nasty, and I keep on talking, talking, talking. I know it's bad, but it happens because I'm not perfect. I'm saying that when someone comes to me and opens up, going to give advice, even though I know one day I'm going to realize that what I said was wrong. But it's just so hard to go to that person and tell that you were wrong, you know? We're just humans; that happens.

Yes, exactly what's important is that you've learned from it. You've learned from making mistakes, and you will not do it again. All right, so um, next question. Do you prefer having a few close friends, or a large circle of acquaintances? So when you say acquaintances, these are the people that you know, but you're not that close. You're not that friends-friends. You were just, you know, you know people. So, those are acquaintances. So do you prefer having a small group or a large circle of acquaintances? Let us have... yeah, I can say Maria's hand. How about you, Maria? Big group or small group? I prefer a close friend, a small group, then people that only I know from, you know, something about it. Yes, cool. How about your preference, Husna? Hey, are you there? I can't hear you. I think your audio was not connected. Can you check? Can't hear you, darling. All right, how about you, IU? What's your preference? Yeah, my preference is definitely like a few close friends because when I was in high school, I already, like, um, how do I say it? Um, something happened with, like, you know, acquaintances and with me. I was a person like that, um, you know, always talked to, uh, everyone and be nice to everyone and, uh, making friends with everyone, but this wasn't work at all. It's because not everyone, uh, you know, feels like we, or not everyone sees the world like me, you know, and there are always some little differences between you and the other person, and we are not generally in, you know, feelings or in thoughts or some, you know, beliefs or something like that that is so deep. Yeah, definitely, but yeah, a little, you know, a few sorry close friends is okay. Like you can open your emotions, your heart to a few persons, and this is, I think, the healthy way. Otherwise, everybody knows what you are struggling with or what you are, but, you know, there's a disadvantage in having a small group, like a small circle of friends, um, because if you two separate, it feels like you break up with a boyfriend, with your other half, right? Yeah, yeah, but when it's like a big, a big circle of friends, a large circle of friends, it doesn't hurt as much because, you know, that, okay, I'm gonna meet some people and be friends with them as soon as possible. Yeah, and you know, as a plus, if you are playing some games, you know, having so many people is also great, like, you know, imagine you have a few couple people and you can't nothing to do, like, you know, but it's gonna make her life dramatic. So I'm gonna suggest you, um, to keep your circle small, otherwise it's gonna be so controversial, dramatic. Okay, thanks for sharing, my dear friend. Um, SAP, how about you? Hi, okay, uh, I like to have, um, a few close friends, but actually, I have never had such a close friend. I always have a large circle of acquaintances, really. I don't feel like, oh yeah, I, I don't have so many close friends, actually. But do you have a friend that you trust the most, like a best friend? Yeah, Malcolm says me. I just muted him because it was interrupting. Go ahead. See, I'm gonna call Malcolm later. Okay, uh, yeah, I had, but at the moment, maybe my sister is my closest friend, but in the past, um, I had some other friends, but I'm not lucky in friends, to be honest. Yeah, because they said that if you have like a large number of people in your life, it's going to be so difficult to find the one who you can trust the most, maybe, but it is easier because, you know, when you have close friends, they may expect you more, but if you have a large circle of acquaintances, then you can be carefree, uh-huh, they don't expect you that much, uh-huh, okay, we got you, whenever you want, that is true. How about you, OIE? A big one or a small one? So, honestly, without end up, it depends on the situation. When it comes to trust, somebody close friends play a vital role in our life, but when it comes to managing your business or something, you should have too many acquaintances in order to enrich your networking system, that is right, yeah, but, uh, I think everyone has two or three close friends who can rely on or like to have a shoulder on them, but when I was studying, our teachers told us like, improve your networking, like, make too many acquaintances in any kind of field, in that case, you will be able to like figure out every kind of problem that you face in every kind of field, like in software engineering or in marketing, yeah, in this case, both ways are right.

But it's up to people, I think, uhhuh, if you are thinking careerwise, then I'm going to say make your network big because of course they would help you, um, when it comes to job, when it comes to clients because they can refer you to different people. But again, when it comes to emotion, when it comes to feeling like personal life, then indeed, for me, for example, if you have kind of kind the shop, in this case, it's good to have too many acquaintances for the because they can buy every day like different things, rather than two or three friends, yeah, exactly right, that is exactly right, if you are thinking wisely, yeah, so be it, okay thank you guys, that is very wise, so okay, this one is good question, have you ever had a disagreement with a friend and how did you resolve it? I want you to take a look, um, take a step back and think of a moment when you had a conflict with a friend and how did you resolve it or is it too personal? 

Okay, Maria, yes, uh, in my experience and as I understand, this is the way to deal with the problems, you know, to cut relationship, it's a no good decision, obviously we are not agree, obviously we are, you know, developing our life, something changed, but when we are not agree and something happened and we cut our relationship, it's always good to leave a small chance to renew it, to renew it, and after several years I see we can send the card to say have a good birthday, happy birthday, congratulations, etc., and even not to speak because it's not so important, you know, after you, you have some bad time with this person, yeah, it's in my experience it's so after several e it's not important so it's good to leave some small, you know door open to continue this relationship because time make for us a lot of things so if it was you somebody does matter from family or from your close environment people that you were well with them, yeah, so why to cut it, why to cut it, you see, it's what I'm doing, what I'm doing and I see from my experience after several times as we say when the U Chiefs subside we see this differently, we see this differently even with can laugh from it, that's it, it's not more important, I got you, okay, a how about you, uh, yeah, in like a close time, like recent times, I had a disagreement with my one of my friends and um, I was a little bit pissed but like um How do I said when I when I'm pissed I'm not generally uh, how do I say it, like if someone smiles to me or laughs to me while I'm pissed off or you know nervous, this makes me crazy like literally crazy, I can't handle it, overreacting yes, like I had a moment like that and like the first time I stopped myself to getting nervous or you know pissed off and I I was trying to come down and breathe, you know, uh, trying to understand other people why uh he is smiling to me or you know what's the reason behind it, and I got it, like uh, there is no bad intention, there was no bad intention between him and I, and got it's just a bad reaction, yes, yeah, there is no bad intention but there is a bad reaction, yeah, some, you know, I have to take control my, you know, like feelings and reactions, yeah, body language also, it's so important, it's okay, I think a lot of people, not just you, um, go through that, even me before I, um, was like reacting badly when you know I'm feeling bad, when I'm upset, so I try to, right now I try to control it because it's gonna, it's gonna make a bad impression in other people, yes, for sure, if they don't know you very well, like they will, they will try to judge you, yes, misunderstanding maybe will happen or, you know, 

hello, what's up Mya, yes, how are you and my colleague, excuse me, I wrote a, yeah, I saw it, I saw it, me so much, no problem, also the last week because of our F, so I cannot join the last, uh, I think Wednesday, last Wednesday, I also joined, that's okay, no problem with that, take your time, Amuna, if you have a guest that you need to attend to, please do it first, we can wait, yes, thank you so much, okay, all right, stay go ahead and then we'll move on to the vocabulary, okay, uh, it happened to me the several, yeah, yeah, you know sometimes it is severe but sometimes it is just not that important, so, um, the one that is severe will, um, you can, you will keep in your mind, it, it, it sticks in your mind and, uh, you know, I wanted to actually, I got angry from her because she was inviting someone that is literally kind of enemy and, uh, and I felt like betrayed, of course, and, uh, but then I try to actually, uh, put myself in her shoes and, uh, think that, um, she will do that even if, uh, he was her enemy because she is so forgiving and kind and, um, maybe crazy, yeah, maybe she is just too friendly, yeah, too friendly, too.

And so I decided to just leave it that way and forget about it, not just accept it that she's like that. Yeah, very a stressful moment. She's a of the nation, like everybody's her friend. Yeah, exactly, you know me, I usually have disagreement and conflict, uh, with my friends. Not because of our attitude but because of I think more and financial. There are friends, there are close friends who are, you know, trying to borrow some from you, and of course, as a friend, you will lend some, of course, even though you do not have much. And that's going to create conflict, you know what I mean, because I have like several friends who were like borrowing from me even though I do not have money. I have this trust that maybe one day when they have enough, they would, um, bring it back or return it, but sadly it was not like that. So beware of those friends who's going to be there one day need you but when you need them they will run away. That's kind of deep. So I try to keep my, um, how do I say it, my grip close as much as possible, or, um, a little because I've learned from that moment I was a friend of a Nation back then like I'm a friend of everybody back then when they need me I'm there but when I need them I'm alone. I think that happens a lot of times to everyone, not just me, right? Okay, so let's learn some words before we go on to the breakout room. So here are the words and phrases related to friendship and bonds. First one, what word is this? This is willing to give or share, showing kindness. This is actually, um, one of the qualities that I like, to be a kind person, to be a kind person, willing to give, a person who likes giving, how do you call that attitude? That is right.

If you would like to, I don't know if it's just me, so I always put melody or rhythm to what I want to remember, that's, I don't know, maybe because I love music, I love singing, so that's why that helped me, maybe that's for you too, you can try.

That's nice that you value something you appreciate. Next, supporting or defending someone, someone's back, like I forgot who's a friend, so this one is to have someone, so you will hear, I got your back, so that's it, yeah, don't worry, I got your back, especially, uh, I generally heard that definition while watching some sports, like exactly like basketball and also football. They say, I got your back. Just, you know, it's like, Don't worry, I'm here. Yeah, yeah, just like that, Don't worry, I'm here, I got your back, or I have your back. But you did not say, I had your back, why you don't say that? I had your back. It was like you betrayed him. Oh yeah, like in this one, it's in the past. Yeah, yeah, it's okay to say, I got your back. So English is crazy, just so you know. Next one, it is to have similar hobbies, preferences, or goals with someone. This one is a phrase as well, when you two get the LA because you're on the same train, or you can say you share common interests. I share common interests with my friend, with my partner, with my husband. Alright, next, you married. You married? No, that's just an example. Oh, okay, because I remember you said Common Ground. Yeah, Common Ground, very good, that's right. Okay, okay, let's go on to the breakout session. And here are the questions you will be discussing. So, I'm going to be giving you 20 minutes in the breakout session, then we will have reflections after the breakout session. I'm going to create three rooms, wait a second. So, I think two was good. Alright, here you go, please join and have fun. Thank you, let me know if I can help in the breakout session. Hi, can you hear me? Yeah? Okay, wonderful. Alright, now what you are going to do is talk about the questions in the chat. So, there are seven questions for this class, and I'd like Iisha to be on the lookout for these questions and try to make your groupmates as chatty as possible. If you have questions, let me know. Okay, thank you, have a great one. Thanks. Is here? Hey, he. Okay, who wants to start first? I will read the question, and who wants to answer, you have to read first. Read the question first, yeah. How do you define a good friend? Like, what does it mean to you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. Don't, okay. A good friend, like, as I said before, he or she, I think, has to have some good qualities, like, for example, reliability, empathy, you know, making empathy and trustworthy, you know, and also a lovely person. I can define a good friend. You know, how about Maya? Yes, I think I have to choose a friend with good character, as you mentioned, and Miguel, and who I can understand, and whom I can find when I have a problem, like, to discuss how to solve it, yes, to rely on him, and also to help for success, to help for the future, yes, build up. Okay, great. How about you, Cherry? Am I saying it correctly? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Cherry. How do you pronounce your name? Please, ah, ah, okay, yes, great. So, to me, a good friend, he or she doesn't need to be perfect, but I hope that they spend time with you, even if you need them. If you call them or you need something, they just say, Oh, I'm busy, so I think it's not a good friend, yeah. Yeah, great point of view, actually, yeah. Like, friendship requires some sacrifice, like you said, you know, creating some time for people, taking care, like, yes, making efforts, you mean. I got you, MH. Great, thank you. How about Sheila? Sheila, are you able to talk? Yes, I'm able to. Hi, hi, hi. It's been a long time since I've seen you. Yeah, a long time. What do you think, Sheila? How do you define a good friend? A good friend is someone who's there for you, no matter what, is honest, respectful, and loyal. That was great. Well done. If someone wants to read, please go ahead. Yes, I can. Please, ask. Yeah, no, yeah, I can be friends with anyone without looking at their religion, beliefs, physical appearance, nationality, language, or interests, of course, because I generally think like that. Like, if someone is different from me, they can definitely teach me something, right? Like, we have other perspectives and we can add to ourselves some information, some knowledge, or some life skills. Maybe you can learn from anyone or something. I mean, this is my idea. Hi, guys. Hi. No, which question? I think it's possible. It's not impossible, because I do that. Like, everything was different in my country, even my relations, and our habits and our values were different, but I was still like a friend, because I think if someone is respectful, there's no problem.

Yeah, I think it's possible. Yeah, I can make friends with people with different language or cultural backgrounds, uh, from different countries. I think, yeah, I can make friends with different kinds of people as long as they want to make friends with me too. I think if we are willing to share our things, willing to spend our time with each other, help each other, then yeah, it's possible it will be good. Uh, yes, I think it is possible. And, uh, if I can give an example, like my colleague during my study or now I live in a different country from my culture, so I meet many, somehow there are traditions and I learn a lot from them. So I think to have a friend for the first time or to go into a relation with them is not bad, yes. All yes, all yes, the benefits are more than the negatives, I think so. I read, okay, the third question, what are some common activities or hobbies that friends often enjoy doing together? I think if it's reading, yes, it is enjoyable, like yes, to share reading, like this books, poetry, or so. And, uh, sports, hobbies, or also to see films or series, yes, all these are activities, or to travel on vacation. My friends also can be enjoyable. What is up? Is it on my picture? Can you see it? No, is it there? I'm not really sure. Uh, but I can just write it here. I want to share, we are in the third question, right? Yes, yes. Okay, I think singing songs and also making some music or, you know, reading books in calm places, for example, near the beach or, you know, just in the forest or, you know, at your friend's house, also like a different area. And what else? Like, uh, sometimes gossiping will be great, but not always. And, you know, eating some snacks while watching, you know, series or films, you know, movies, those are very great for me. Yeah, exactly, don't be shy. Yes, of course. I think going on, I am so sorry. Sorry, teacher, go ahead. I think it depends on who we are, like sometimes if we're with people that are near for us, like with my friends that are here, we are playing some games and like, uh, talking even sometimes, like talking about politicians. But I actually let others choose it because everything is fun for me. So, oh, it depends. Like, if I'm with you, I know some of you love to sing songs, so I just hear it and say like, silent. But if I'm with my Arab people, I have lots of Arab people. We love to talk in different accents and we love to make fun like that. Great, thank you for sharing. Yeah, I just forgot. Ah, yes, today you look very beautiful and shiny, attractive, more attractive. Is this because of the Heat Fest or because of our Eid Fest? I'm sorry, because of the Festival of Ramadan, fast? Or, uh, no, not like that, but uh, for a long time, I was thinking to, you know, not covering my head anymore. I have some questions on my head, waiting to answer it, but just want to do it. I know in the future maybe I will change again, you know. So this is the, you know, you do not, you, you what is called, uh, you decide not to cover your hair? Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah. But are there reasons behind this, you know, this is something special. Uh, but let me, you know, uh, say, how to say, sometimes when I'm looking at myself, I didn't feel like the, like me on the inside, like while I'm looking at myself, you know, in the mirror. I don't feel like the person is me. Like sometimes I had some difficulties to understand why we are covering, why men don't cover like fully, you know. I have some questions and I have also right now have questions again and I'm searching, actually, the reason behind the covering again and trying to understand why, why is the reason or something like that. It's a temporary situation, I don't know, because I'm not getting used to it right now. This is so, you know, super fresh thing for me, like this is so scary and also exciting at the same time. So I'm trying to use it, but who knows, yeah. Still personal conviction or you have to find and get your way, yeah. Yeah, maybe one day, yes. Yeah, I have to find my way, like on my own and while searching, you know, yeah, yeah, I'm sure. I just want to say something like, you're like different with us, but I'm not like different. I feel like you feel different with us, but we are comfortable with you. Like we are accepting you in every situation. It's your choice and it's good to figure out, like, I also, like, firstly, I understand why we should cover, and it is, like, popular these days. People keep on using this to describe someone who, like, do not care or does not give a name. Okay, so, like, I was sharing to people here about the word nonchalant.

Are you guys familiar with it? No, no, I wrote on the chat it's nonchalant. Yeah, you put it in chat. Thank you. Have you heard of it? No, no, no, really. It is an English word. This is actually a formal word for saying you are unbuttered or you do not care. So if you feel like you don't care or I don't give them, you are nonchalant.

Okay, these days, but before not because this one is a very formal, very English word. Is it a positive? No, okay, okay. So a lot of people these days are using it. Like if you do not care, you are unbothered, then you are nonchalant. For example, yeah. Oh, for example. So I'm gonna consider myself as OA. Do you guys know OA? No. So when you say that you are OA, you are overreacting, overacting. Yeah, okay. So when you are overreacting, um, the opposite side of that is nonchalant. When you are nonchalant, you do not react at all, like me, like that. So they are opposite. You can have a boyfriend who is nonchalant and the girlfriend is OA.

So I'm gonna say it's good. They complete each other, you know, they complete each other. It's good, especially in a relationship. That's right. So what do you consider yourself, Miguel? Would you consider yourself nonchalant or an OA? I think you are OA because you talk a lot. I'm gonna say that's what I think. How about me? What do you think of me? Do you think I'm nonchalant or OA? Non, yes. O, o, o, a. I am very OA. Really? Yeah, we were lucky because you were nonchalant with us. Really? No, no, no, no. It's just that I have to respect your boundaries. But when it comes to controversial things, I'm very OA with that. Like I overreact a lot of times. But when it comes to, you know, in the class because that's so, I'm going to be nonchalant about it. Nonchalant is a positive quality, right? It's, I think it depends on the situation, right? Because if it's too serious, for example, someone is having a heart attack and you are just nonchalant about it, so that's gonna be a bad thing.

Okay, right. Okay, so that's going to be all for our today's class. Tomorrow it's going to be with Alian bro. Thank you so much for, okay, I just forgot to do something. You send us PDF, yes, correct. So Miguel, could you please contact me on my email, just send me a message there so I can send the copy of PDF, then you can distribute it with your classmates tomorrow, all right? Thank you very much. Bye-bye and see you. Goodbye, everybody. Bye-bye for.
