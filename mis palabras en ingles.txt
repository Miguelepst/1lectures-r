Dialogue with oneself - Spontaneous.

I'm here talking to myself and hypothesizing dialogues that I can even apply with others.

The idea is to transform these dialogues, starting by talking to oneself and then developing a methodology to achieve complete freedom when speaking to myself, and subsequently, achieving fluent communication with others.

It's not necessary to wait to be the best to start because if one fills oneself with the best of oneself, one already becomes the best.

Now, let's imagine a fictional dialogue, as if I were talking to Professor X-name.

According to my ideas and experiences, I feel that you are more of a Spanish teacher than an English one.

When a person learns a language, they do it in that same language.

For example, we are not taught Spanish from another language, but we are taught starting from Spanish itself.

At first, we don't understand the meaning of the words, we simply repeat them without comprehending.

I have had the opportunity to assist children who come to buy something on behalf of their mother, and many of them just repeat what they are told without understanding.

For instance, when they are asked to buy a lollipop, they come repeating 'good morning' as a greeting before asking for the lollipop, but sometimes they don't pronounce the word correctly.

Then, I check if they have the appropriate money because sometimes they bring 100 pesos instead of the 500 that the lollipop costs.

After giving them the lollipop, I continue with the usual protocol, saying 'you're welcome,' to which they sometimes respond similarly, and sometimes they don't know what to say.

After repeating 'you're welcome' several times, they finally look at me and respond the same.

"the same"

They don't say 'thank you' or other words of gratitude.

What do you think this means?

WHAT PART OF YOUR IDENTITY ARE YOU MOST COMFORTABLE SHARING WITH OTHER PEOPLE?

  WHAT PART OF YOUR IDENTITY ARE YOU LEAST COMFORTABLE SHARING WITH OTHER PEOPLE?

The part of my identity with which I feel most comfortable sharing with others is respect, kindness, and joy.

Sharing something other than respect, kindness, and joy is not very comfortable for me. For this reason, it does not define me, and I do not offer it to others.

DO YOU THINK WE HAVE CONTROL IN OUR IDENTITY?

DO WE DETERMINE OUR IDENTITY OR DO OTHERS DETERMINE OUR IDENTITY?

I believe that every individual does have the power of choice, which allows them to decide who has control over their identity.

DID YOU STRUGGLE WITH ANY PART OF YOUR IDENTITY WHILE GROWING UP?

IF YES, WHAT PART OF YOUR IDENTITY DID YOU STRUGGLE THE MOST WITH GROWING UP?


Oh yes, definitely. When I was a child, I loved being outside. I was a real street kid, skipping meals just to play soccer with my friends. I remember that being a big problem because my parents would scold me and punish me by forbidding me from going out the next day. That was before adolescence.

Another point I struggled with was during my teenage years. At this age, I experienced all kinds of emotions: anger, sadness, joy, complex feelings. I remember my first girlfriend and also the first time she broke up with me.

Now I look back on it all with great joy, but back then it wasn't so fun. The problem was not knowing how to deal with certain situations at that age.

In my case, as I've grown, life has taught me to improve, mature, and identify what truly matters and what doesn't. This has enabled me to handle difficult situations in a wise manner.

WHAT PART OF YOUR IDENTITY DO YOU SEE HAVING THE MOST EFFECT ON YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH CO-WORKERS? WITH FRIENDS? WITH FAMILY?

As I answered in the first question.

It's easy, I like to apply the golden rule: treat others as you want to be treated, whether they are coworkers, friends, or family.

I believe that you should first earn trust, especially when it comes to making jokes with someone else.

2. IS IDENTITY OFTEN DISCUSSED IN YOUR COUNTRY?

WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR FAMILY?

In the country where I was born and where I currently live, there is great diversity in all aspects. It is a democratic country.

These discussions are not very common, but there may be exceptions.

There is a lot of diversity among political parties.

It is common to see political discussions on the news.

Within the family, we exchange opinions about what we see in the news, but we mostly talk about family matters or close relatives.

1. HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE YOURSELF?

WHAT GROUPS ARE YOU A PART OF THAT DETERMINE YOUR IDENTITY?

Well, I consider myself a grateful human being. I don't believe that I am superior to anyone else, and I also don't believe that any other human being is superior based on their cultural or economic differences.

I am a kind and respectful person.

I don't belong to any religious or other types of groups.

I know that God exists, and I enjoy feeling His presence in my heart. I also love being able to see Him in everything around me.

I have a direct relationship with God, which means that while I may enjoy visiting prayer groups, I understand that I don't depend on any particular group or place to express my gratitude.

I value respect and offer it to others.

I believe that what I give, I receive in return.

Cultural and religious differences are neutral to me; neither good nor bad, they simply exist.

I make an effort to feel filled with the best in order to share it with others.

No group determines my identity.

I can only say that I am identified with life, with this breath, with this moment of existence.

In my opinion, every living human being belongs to the group of those who exist. It is a group where humans are at peace, love one another, and respect life.

The moment comes when you lower the accumulation of studying and practicing predefined static content, to start addressing the topic of dynamic fluency in speech. This is where the brain will put into real use what you have accumulated.

And this is where fluency can be measured, for example, the number of fluent words in a dialogue that you can generate in 30 seconds, or longer depending on the metric you choose.

In this way, I will start learning to give it practical use.

It's like starting to work towards the ultimate goal, as you're learning English to communicate in that language, both spoken and written, with other people.

What I'm essentially doing is recording my fluency and capturing those points where I lose my flow. I extract those words or phrases that I didn't know how to express in English, which caused the pauses. I look up their translations in English and work on them directly through repetitive practice.

Personalizing the English language to match my way of communicating.

Once I have identified those precise places where these errors arise that make me lose fluency in speech, these unpleasant pauses, as they can also be called, where I don't know how to say what I want to say correctly in a language I am learning.

Identifying and capturing the error or errors is the most wonderful thing that can happen to you in your process of learning fluency in a new language.

Because you will work directly and precisely on the error, in those places where the pauses begin.

You answer questions like:

What stopped my fluency? What word did I need at that moment when I didn't know how to say it?

Practicing speech fluency is a very independent and important aspect that I will inevitably go through. I decide when I want to start this practice. All the other practices are helpful, but this practice takes everything you have accumulated from studying and practicing and allows you to use it fluently in a real dialogue between two people.

This is where a new brain skill emerges.

And in this way, I directly tackle the error.



4-

Definitely, that is the reason.

The points where I experience these pauses, where my fluency stops, and I start to think about the words I will say, that's when the error begins.



3-

The idea is to speak fluently, that's the objective, but for some reason, I don't know what it could be, the most likely one is that I need more practice. As they say, practice makes perfect.

In the moments when I have virtual meetings, I like to take the opportunity to practice my speaking fluency in English.
