Hi Miguel! Glad to connect here! If you want to send the audio tasks for the 7-day challenge via voice notes here, 
it may be easier than uploading files to the Drive. 
I will leave feedback there but you can send voice messages freely here! 
Your second task is available shortly so I just wanted to see how you're doing so far

Oh, that's great, excellent, thank you very much, Danna. 
If I'm in the process of developing my first task, I would say I'm at 60% thanks to the closeness to the learning process.

Really good to see what you've put together!
Just so you know, after the first part, there appears to be other stuff going on on the screen. 
For pronunciation, "own" and "arrangements" (clip to follow)
Next time, try to focus on being concise and giving examples immediately after the explanation. "Let's think of future arrangements we can make. How about a camping trip in spring? We'll go to the mountains. Of course, we'll need a tent too, so I'll ask my brother if I can borrow his." 
Your explanations are good but this would be best kept to under 10 minutes, as people have a tough time watching grammar lessons for longer!

Do you know there are tricks for identifying the stressed syllable in a word? 

For example, with -ion words, the syllable before the suffix (-ion) is stressed.
🌟 pro nun ci A tion 
🌟 pol LU tion 
🌟 e MIS sion
🌟 cal cu LA tion 
🌟 tran SI tion 
🌟 in spi RA tion

What other -ion words do you know? (Try to use those that would be helpful to your #GlobalGoals/#SDG supporters)
And don't forget to make requests in the comments for future mini-lessons during our #e4econsistencychallenge 

See you tomorrow for day 8

Hi Miguel, all should be in order. Please let me know! You can send me the voice message here outlining the tasks you do weekly and how you categorize them. I think it's an important reflection to make so that I can make relevant recommendations.

Also was wondering - how is your daily routine of speaking to yourself in the morning going?
I thought I'd add this task to the challenge (I am planning to rerecord it before summer). I like it a lot:

1. Record yourself for seven days as soon as you wake up. Tell yourself at least one thing you're grateful for. Try to remember your dreams. 
2. Tkink of six things that you want to make happen by the end of the day. Include this in your recording. 
3. Listen to recording at least two times throughout the day- once after an hour, to write down the six tasks you have planned for the day. Note grammar mistakes. Listen at the end of day once tasks are complete. 

This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes out of your day but will help you with gaining more fluidity in expressing yourself. Also will get your ear used to hearing you speak

Just want to note that there are some places where the sentences are a bit difficult to understand. ..."that teaches you day by day and it is a very good lesson that I can also apply go learn what I am proposing", for example. 
The essence of your point comes across and I love the way you personify life. You certainly have the right mindset! 

I do want to emphasize that the point of the task was to categorize the activities you do so that I could have a bit better idea of your schedule! Since a lot of people join the challenge when they are at a point where they have been working on their practice but feel like they're not making progress, it is important to map out the time that we are spending consciously before setting goals. I hope that makes sense.

At the age of 9, Robert Kiyosaki and his best friend Mike asked Mike's father (Rich Dad) to teach them how to make money.

23
After 3 weeks spent cleaning one of Mike's Dad's many stores for a poverty wage (10 cents a week!), Kiyosaki couldn't take it anymore and increasingly began to think about quitting.

24
This is the moment that Rich Dad chose to give him his first lesson about money: some people leave their job because they are not being paid enough.

25
Others see it as the opportunity to learn something new.

Hi Miguel! So happy to hear you're working on reading out loud. Overall, sounds really good. 
Just some tips. 
· "Stores"is one syllable. 
· It is "little" money (rather than less- less is used for comparisons)
· Also remember the importance of using the third person singular subjects with the right verbs (ending in -s in present simple tense) People think, but he thinks  
· I am practicing* (not "I am practice" this is the present progressive tense)
· I have trouble OR I have a problem but not "I have a trouble"

Your summaries of what you read were great! You're doing wonderfully. Keep going
