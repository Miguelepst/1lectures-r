Upload a voice clip to your drive folder telling me what brings you joy and what you've got planned related to joy-bearing activities, and what you believe will continue to bring you joy throughout the next year, or even throughout your life. 
Explain (either in a written document or voice clip) how you are going to incorporate English into *those activities*

Answer:
What brings me joy varies widely, but there are some constants in my life that consistently bring me happiness. Engaging in creative activities, such as singing, listening to music, or teaching, always lifts my spirits. I find joy in learning new things, whether it's a new language, a musical instrument, or a new skill. Spending quality time with loved ones, whether having a meaningful conversation, going on adventures, or simply sharing a meal, brings me immense joy.

Incorporating English into these activities is relatively easy and enjoyable. When I sing, I can explore different genres and styles in English, challenging myself to express ideas and emotions in new ways. When I listen to music, I can listen to podcasts or audiobooks in English, immersing myself in the language while engaging in a relaxing activity. Learning a new skill, such as playing a musical instrument, can involve learning songs in English or watching tutorials in English to improve my language skills.

Incorporating English into spending time with loved ones can be as simple as having conversations in English, watching movies in English together, or playing language learning games. By incorporating English into these activities that bring me joy, I not only improve my language skills but also deepen my enjoyment of these activities by adding a new layer of learning and discovery.

Looking ahead, I believe these activities will continue to bring me joy over the next year and beyond. As I continue to explore new creative ventures, learn new skills, and spend time with loved ones, English will remain a constant companion, enriching my experiences and helping me connect with others who share my interests.
