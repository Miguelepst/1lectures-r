Question1 (past simple):
How did your English practice take shape? Where did you start? (simple past)
For example, Did you have formal English studies or did you learn on your own? 
Did you learn only to read and write but not have the chance (or the confidence) to speak? 
Were you raised in a bilingual household but always responded to English in another language?

Anwser:
My journey with English began when I was a child. I grew up in a bilingual household where English was spoken alongside my native language. However, despite this exposure, I did not actively start learning English until I began formal education. My first experiences with the language were in school, where English was a mandatory subject.
In the beginning, I primarily focused on reading and writing. These skills were taught in a structured manner, with textbooks and grammar exercises. I remember learning about basic grammar rules, such as verb conjugations and sentence structures. I also practiced writing short paragraphs and essays to improve my writing skills.
Although I was learning to read and write in English, I did not have many opportunities to speak the language. This lack of practice made me feel less confident in my speaking abilities. I was hesitant to speak English because I was afraid of making mistakes or being misunderstood. As a result, I often stuck to my native language when communicating with others.
Despite these challenges, my interest in English continued to grow. I started watching English movies and TV shows to immerse myself in the language. I also began listening to English music and reading English books to expand my vocabulary. These activities helped me become more familiar with the language and improve my listening skills.
As I progressed through school, my English skills improved. I became more comfortable speaking English and started to participate more in class discussions. I also began to seek out opportunities to practice speaking outside of the classroom. I joined English clubs and conversation groups where I could interact with other English learners and native speakers.
Overall, my English practice took shape through a combination of formal studies and self-directed learning. While formal education provided me with a solid foundation in reading and writing, it was through my own efforts that I was able to develop my speaking and listening skills. My journey with English has been challenging at times, but it has also been incredibly rewarding. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to learn and grow in the language, and I look forward to continuing my journey as an English learner.


Question2 (past simple):
What negative feelings or emotions have you associated in the past with your English practice? 

For example, fear, anxiety, disappointment, embarrassment, anger, etc. 
What did you learn from those feelings? 
What would you tell your past self to dispel the negativity and use that energy instead to improve? 

Anwser 
In the past, I associated several negative feelings and emotions with my English practice, such as fear, anxiety, and disappointment. These emotions often stemmed from a lack of confidence in my abilities, especially when faced with challenging aspects of the language like pronunciation or complex grammar rules.
One particular incident that stands out is when I had to give a presentation in English. I felt anxious and worried about making mistakes in front of my classmates, which led to feelings of embarrassment and self-doubt. Despite preparing extensively, I struggled to speak fluently and coherently, which only reinforced my negative feelings towards my English practice.
From these experiences, I learned that negative emotions can be powerful motivators for improvement if channeled correctly. Instead of letting fear or anxiety hold me back, I realized that I could use these feelings as fuel to push myself out of my comfort zone and strive for improvement.
If I could go back and talk to my past self, I would tell them to embrace these negative feelings as natural parts of the learning process. Making mistakes is inevitable, but it is through these mistakes that we learn and grow. I would encourage my past self to adopt a growth mindset, focusing on progress rather than perfection. I would remind them that everyone starts somewhere and that improvement takes time and patience.
I would also advise my past self to seek support from others, whether it be through teachers, classmates, or online communities. Sharing my struggles and learning from others' experiences can help me realize that I am not alone in my journey and that everyone faces challenges in their language learning.
Furthermore, I would remind my past self to celebrate small victories along the way. Every improvement, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction. By acknowledging and celebrating these achievements, I can stay motivated and continue making progress.
In conclusion, while negative feelings and emotions are a natural part of the language learning process, they can be turned into positive energy for improvement. By embracing these feelings, seeking support, and celebrating progress, I can overcome challenges and continue to grow in my English practice.


Question 3.1. (past continuous):
What were you doing to improve your skills at that time? (past continuous)

Anwser: 
At the time in question, I was deeply focused on honing my skills in various ways. One of the key strategies I was employing was consistent practice and repetition. I firmly believed that practice makes perfect, so I dedicated a significant amount of time each day to practicing. Whether it was English pronunciation, grammar, or reading comprehension, I made sure to immerse myself in the language as much as possible.
Furthermore, I was actively seeking out resources that could help me improve. I scoured the internet for articles, videos, and podcasts related to trending topics in English. By exposing myself to authentic English content, I was not only improving my language skills but also gaining valuable insights into current events and global issues.
In addition to self-study, I was also engaging in conversation with native speakers whenever possible. I sought out language exchange partners and joined online communities where I could practice speaking English in a supportive environment. These interactions were incredibly valuable as they allowed me to apply what I had learned in a real-world context and receive immediate feedback.
Moreover, I was taking formal English classes to supplement my self-study efforts. These classes provided a structured curriculum and expert guidance, which helped me progress more rapidly. I was also attending workshops and seminars focused on English language learning, where I could learn new strategies and techniques from experienced educators.
Overall, my approach to improving my English skills at that time was multifaceted and immersive. I was committed to constant learning and growth, and I believe that my efforts during that period laid a solid foundation for my continued language development.


Question 3.2. (simple past with negatives):
What worked for you and what didn't? (simple past with negatives)

Anwser: 
What worked for me was setting specific goals and deadlines. I found that when I had clear objectives, I was more motivated to study and improve my English skills. However, what didn't work for me was trying to learn too much at once. When I overloaded myself with too many tasks or tried to learn too many new words in a short amount of time, I became overwhelmed and frustrated. This made it difficult for me to retain the information and made the learning process less enjoyable.
Another thing that worked for me was practicing regularly. I found that when I set aside time each day to practice English, whether it was reading articles, watching videos, or speaking with native speakers, I saw significant improvement in my language skills. On the other hand, what didn't work for me was procrastinating. When I put off practicing or studying, I found it harder to get back into the routine and often ended up feeling like I was falling behind.
Additionally, what worked for me was finding resources that I enjoyed. I discovered that I learned best when I was interested in the material, so I made an effort to find articles, books, and videos that I found engaging. However, what didn't work for me was using resources that were too difficult or not well-suited to my level. When I tried to tackle material that was too advanced, I became frustrated and felt like I wasn't making progress.
In conclusion, setting clear goals, practicing regularly, and finding enjoyable resources were all things that worked for me in my English language learning journey. However, trying to do too much at once, procrastinating, and using resources that weren't a good fit for me were all things that didn't work. By learning from my experiences and adjusting my approach, I was able to improve my English skills and become more confident in my abilities.


Question 3.1 For example: 
Did you notice that you had trouble with certain types of text, such as news articles? 

Answer:
Yes, I did notice that I had trouble with certain types of text, such as news articles. When I first started learning English, I found news articles challenging because they often contain complex vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and specialized terminology. As a learner, I struggled to understand the main ideas and details presented in these articles, which made it difficult for me to grasp the overall message or purpose of the text.
One of the reasons I had trouble with news articles was because of the language used. News articles are written in a formal style, with a focus on clarity and accuracy. This means that they often use advanced vocabulary and grammar structures that may not be familiar to someone who is still learning English. Additionally, news articles often contain references to current events, political issues, and cultural topics that may be unfamiliar to non-native speakers, making it challenging to fully comprehend the content.
Another factor that contributed to my difficulty with news articles was the speed at which information is presented. News articles are typically written to convey information quickly and concisely, which means that they can be dense and packed with information. For someone who is still learning English, this can be overwhelming and make it hard to keep up with the flow of the text.
To improve my understanding of news articles, I focused on building my vocabulary and grammar skills. I made an effort to learn new words and phrases, especially those commonly used in news articles. I also practiced reading news articles regularly to become more familiar with the style and structure of this type of text. Additionally, I sought out resources that explained current events and news topics in simpler language, which helped me to better understand the content of news articles.
Over time, I noticed that my ability to comprehend news articles improved. I became more comfortable with the language used in news articles and more adept at identifying the main ideas and key details. While news articles can still be challenging at times, I feel more confident in my ability to understand and analyze them.

Question 3.2 For example: 
Did you feel more comfortable watching videos when you had control over the play/pause button?

Anwser:
Yes, I did feel more comfortable watching videos when I had control over the play/pause button. Having the ability to control the playback allowed me to watch at my own pace and ensure that I understood the content before moving on. This control was particularly helpful when watching educational videos or tutorials, as I could pause to take notes or rewind to review a concept. It also gave me the freedom to watch videos in environments where interruptions were common, such as a noisy coffee shop or a crowded bus.
Additionally, having control over the play/pause button helped me manage my time more effectively. I could easily pause a video if I needed to step away for a moment, without missing any important information. This flexibility was especially useful when I had a busy schedule and limited time to dedicate to watching videos. Being able to pause and resume at any time allowed me to fit video-watching into my day without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.
Furthermore, having control over the play/pause button made me feel more engaged with the content. Instead of passively watching a video, I could actively interact with it by pausing to reflect on what I had learned or to ask questions. This interactive experience helped me retain information better and made the learning process more enjoyable.
In conclusion, having control over the play/pause button while watching videos made me feel more comfortable, engaged, and in control of my learning experience. It allowed me to watch videos at my own pace, manage my time effectively, and actively interact with the content. Overall, I believe that having this control greatly enhanced my video-watching experience.

Question 4 (present perfect continuous)
What have you been doing since then? (present perfect continuous)

Anwser:
Since then, I have been engrossed in honing my English teaching skills and expanding my knowledge in language education. The journey has been enriching and enlightening, as I have delved deep into various aspects of teaching, such as curriculum development, lesson planning, and classroom management. I have also been actively involved in exploring innovative teaching methodologies and incorporating them into my practice.
Moreover, I have been immersing myself in the world of English language learning resources, constantly seeking out new materials and approaches to enhance my teaching effectiveness. This has involved reading extensively on language acquisition theories, attending workshops and seminars, and engaging with other educators in meaningful discussions. I have also been utilizing technology to create engaging and interactive learning experiences for my students, incorporating tools like online games, videos, and virtual reality simulations into my lessons.
In addition to my professional development, I have been pursuing my passion for music by dedicating time to playing the guitar. Music has always been a source of joy and relaxation for me, and I find that it helps me unwind and recharge after a long day of teaching. I have also been exploring new genres and styles of music, broadening my musical horizons and challenging myself to learn new techniques and songs.
Overall, the past few months have been incredibly rewarding, as I have been able to combine my love for teaching with my passion for learning and personal growth. I am excited to continue this journey and see where it takes me next, confident that I am on the right path towards becoming the best English teacher I can be.

Question 6 (5!) (present continuous)
What are you doing now? (present continuous)

Answer:
Right now, I am responding to your question. I am using the present continuous tense to describe what I am currently doing. As I formulate this response, I am thinking about how best to convey my thoughts to you. I am considering the structure of my answer, ensuring that it is clear and easy to understand.
Additionally, I am paying attention to detail, making sure that I address the specific request in your question. I am also keeping track of the word count, aiming to provide a response that meets your requirement for approximately 500 words.
While I write this response, I am also reflecting on the importance of the present continuous tense in English. This tense is used to describe actions that are happening right now, at the moment of speaking. It helps us to communicate about what is currently taking place, allowing us to express ourselves more precisely.
Moreover, I am aware of the context in which you have asked this question. You are likely practicing the present continuous tense and seeking examples to understand its usage better. By providing this detailed response, I hope to assist you in your learning journey.
In conclusion, I am currently composing this response, focusing on using the present continuous tense to describe my actions as I write. I am using my knowledge of English grammar to construct a coherent and informative answer that meets your requirements.

Question 7 (want + infinitive) 
7. Where do you want to be in a year? (want + infinitive) 

Answer:
In a year, I want to be in a place where I am more proficient in teaching English, having honed my skills and developed a deeper understanding of the language. Specifically, I want to have completed a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certification course, which would equip me with the necessary tools and techniques to be an effective English teacher. This certification would not only enhance my teaching abilities but also open up opportunities to teach English in different parts of the world, which is something I aspire to do.
Additionally, I want to be more confident in my English pronunciation, as I believe this is crucial for effective communication, especially in a teaching environment. To achieve this, I plan to continue practicing pronunciation exercises regularly and seek feedback from native speakers to improve my accent and intonation.
Furthermore, I want to have a better grasp of English grammar, including more advanced concepts such as tense, mood, and voice. This would enable me to explain grammar rules more effectively to my students and help them understand and use English grammar more accurately.


In terms of reading, I want to have expanded my reading skills to include more complex texts, such as academic articles and literary works. This would not only enrich my own understanding of the English language but also allow me to introduce my students to a wider range of reading materials, helping them improve their reading comprehension and vocabulary.
In a year, I also want to have developed a habit of regularly reading articles related to trending topics in English, as this would not only keep me updated with current events but also help me improve my voc
