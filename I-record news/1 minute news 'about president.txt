Give me different ways to say the same thing with the words in a different order, playing with the grammar. Use the same words: 
"Without changing the paragraph, break it down into short sentences and number them"

Sure! Here are different ways to convey the same instruction with the words rearranged:

1. **"Break the paragraph down into short sentences and number them, without changing it."**
   - **Explanation:** This variation places the instruction to break down and number the sentences first, with the constraint about not changing the paragraph following it.

2. **"Without changing it, break the paragraph into short sentences and number them."**
   - **Explanation:** Here, the constraint about not changing the paragraph is presented upfront, followed by the actions of breaking down and numbering the sentences.

3. **"Number them and break down the paragraph into short sentences, without changing it."**
   - **Explanation:** This structure emphasizes the actions of numbering and breaking down first, and then states that the paragraph should not be altered.
