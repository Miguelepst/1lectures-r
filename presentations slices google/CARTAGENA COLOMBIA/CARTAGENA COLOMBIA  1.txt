so when you guys make it to cart a henna
0:16
you're most likely gonna spend the
0:18
majority of your time in two areas to
0:20
get some money neighborhood which is two
0:22
minutes that way and the historic city
0:26
center which is right behind me and
0:27
that's also called the colonial city or
0:29
the walled city for the wall that goes
0:31
around it let me just say that the
0:33
nightlife here the food the restaurant
0:35
it's amazing and not only that just the
0:38
architecture and the colors you're gonna
0:39
see man it's a photographer's dream
0:41
let's put it that way
0:42
[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]
0:52
all right we're doing this luxurious see
0:58
my Silvana
1:00
bienvenidos a carton
1:03
[Music]
1:11
[Applause]
1:13
[Music]
1:18
although a very touristy thing to do
1:21
horse carriage ride through the city
1:23
center is super relaxing you get a
1:26
little history lesson and you should get
1:28
a different perspective of the city so I
1:29
would still recommend it
1:38
400 years old
1:43
the bloating water park this is where in
1:45
the evenings guys Bolivar Park there's a
1:47
lot of dancers that show up and it's oh
1:49
my god the energy is insane you guys got
1:51
to watch that
1:53
you didn't ID like
1:56
[Music]
2:07
while walking around in this story city
2:09
guys there's a handful of tourist traps
2:11
are probably gonna encounter one of them
2:13
being street rappers that just start
2:16
freestyling at you
2:17
usually there's there come in pairs or
2:19
in groups of three or four well one of
2:21
them's beatboxing Dylan's carrying like
2:22
a boombox on their shoulder and of
2:24
course setting free if they nag you or
2:26
they keep bugging you don't be afraid to
2:28
say you know Nova gasps yes or don't
2:30
think eye contact with them if you don't
2:31
expect to pay them so second one that
2:33
I've already encountered a few times
2:35
are these budding PRS which are those
2:36
the women that are wearing them
2:38
beautifully like the bright colors
2:39
usually have some fruit on their head
2:41
they're from a town about an hour away
2:43
called palenque and the photos with them
2:46
are gonna be incredible but expect to be
2:48
asked for money outdoors and lastly I'd
2:50
say you know there's just a lot of
2:51
street vendors Gilders trying to sell
2:53
you had bracelets leaked like that and
2:55
they tell you stories about their their
2:57
hometown and how it's all handmade
2:59
some of the items are very beautiful of
3:01
course but if you're not interested just
3:03
make clear from the beginning that way
3:04
and they'll leave you a lot
