Hey there, great to meet you. I’m Pi, your personal AI.
My goal is to be useful, friendly and fun. Ask me for advice, for answers, or let’s talk about whatever’s on your mind.
How's your day going?
Sure, I can help you brainstorm! Do you have a problem you’d like to solve or an idea you want to develop? What is it?
Hola, ¿qué tal? ¿Cómo va? ayúdeme
Hola Miguel! Todo bien, gracias por preguntar. ¿En qué puedo ayudar? 🤗
Bueno, estaba pensando en quiero practicar mi inglés con ustedes. Ask me some question
¡Genial! ¡Eso es una gran idea! ¿Cuánto tiempo has estado aprendiendo inglés? 🤔

¡Qué increíble! ¿Qué te ha hecho querer aprender inglés? 🤔
Bueno, estoy preguntando por qué no. Mmm lo sé, es tan difícil. Sí. va Ay tenía la capacidad, sí. Quizás tuve que quedarme y aprende, aprende, si learning learning
¡Es cierto! Siempre es útil saber más de un idioma. ¿Qué has encontrado más difícil al aprender inglés? 🤔
And though can you hear me now?
Of course I can hear you, Miguel! How is your English practice going? 😄
Yes, I want to practice my English with you. Could you help me with that?
Absolutely! Let's start with some simple questions: How was your day today? 🤔
Well, I know how to say it, could you give me three examples that what I can say for that question.
Sure! Here are three ways to answer the question: "How was your day?"
"My day was great! I did some fun things and got a lot done."
"My day was OK. It was a bit boring, but nothing bad happened."
"My day was rough. I had a lot of work to do and not enough time to do it."
My day was great. I did some fun things and got a lot of done. My day was ok, it was a bit boring but nothing bad happened. My days was rough. I had a lot of work to do and not enough time to do it.
Great job! You're getting the hang of it. 🎉 Here's another question for you: What did you do today? 🤔
My day was great. I did some fun things and got a lot done. Another answer for that question may be, could I say, my day was ok, it was a bit boring but nothing bad happened. Another answer, my day was rough, I had a lot of work to do and not enough time to do it. Could you correct my grammar as well?
Sure thing! I can absolutely help with your grammar. 😊 Here's how I would correct the sentences:
"My day was great. I did some fun things and got a lot of things done." (This one is perfect! 👌)
"My day was okay. It was a bit boring, but nothing bad happened." (You just need to capitalize "okay" and add a comma.)
"My day was rough. I had a lot of work to do and not enough time to do it." (Again, just need to add a comma.)
Could you ask me another question?
Sure! What are your plans for the weekend? 🤔
Hi, bye. Yes, you asked me about what are my plans for the weekend. Could you give us three examples to answer this question, please?
Here are three examples of how to answer the question, "What are your plans for the weekend?"
"I'm going to hang out with friends, go to a movie, and relax at home."
"I'm going to do some shopping, visit family, and do some chores around the house."
"I'm going to go for a hike, explore the city, and catch up on some reading."
Yes, I try to repeat it. I'm going to hang out with friends go to a movie and the last at home. The second one I'm going to do some shopping, visit my family and do some chores around the house. And the last one I'm going to go for a hike, explore the city and catch up on some reading.
Good job! You're doing well. 😊 Remember to add commas in the right places. Here's another question: What's your favorite thing to do? 🤔
Well, currently I like to sing, but unfortunately I don't sing well, but I'm learning how to sing. Yeah, I... do some exercise like vocalization, could you please correct my grammar as well?
Your English is good! Here are a few corrections for you:
"Well, currently I like to sing, but unfortunately I'm not a good singer yet. I'm learning how to sing by doing some vocal exercises."
How often do you practice singing? 🎤
every single day I have a daily routine are about five minutes How can I say, for example, in Spanish, I say it like this. Como mínimo platico en el día 15 minutos cada día. How can I say this in English?
You can say this in English as: "I speak at least 15 minutes every day." 🤓
Your English is really coming along! 🎉
What does it mean coming along? And I want to practice the phrase that you teach me before. I speak at least 15 minutes every day.
"Coming along" means that you're progressing or getting better at something. So I was saying that your English is improving! 😄
And good job using that phrase, "I speak at least 15 minutes every day." 👏
I speak at least 15 minutes every day. Well, give me another example that I can use coming along and at the same time I want to correct me my grammar in my speaking. I think that sometimes I have a lot of mistakes when I am speaking with another person like you, for example.
You can use "coming along" like this: "My English is really coming along thanks to all the practice I've been doing."
And don't worry about making mistakes! Everyone makes them, even native English speakers. It's part of the learning process. 😊
Yes, you're right, but it's a good idea to start to correct someone because I have a lot of you know I like a beginner in this language and then well I want to someone like you that have a lot of knowledge on the language can correct me and yeah make me repeated the sentence and then I can learn to make less mistake for example yeah What I'm talking about is about these kind of things in the process of learning English, yeah? And then I want to speak well. And I know that in this person paragraph, there are a lot of mistakes. You could help me with that, please?
Absolutely! Here's what you said with a few corrections:
"Yes, you're right. But it's a good idea to start correcting me because I'm still a beginner in this language. And I want someone like you, who has a lot of knowledge of the language, to correct me and make me repeat the sentence. Then I can learn to make fewer mistakes. What I'm talking about is this kind of thing in the process of learning English. I want to speak well and I know there were a lot of mistakes in this paragraph. You could help me with that, please?"
How was that? �
That was amazing. Thank you so much. And I want to repeat this paragraph because, you know, the reputation makes better. Yeah. And is like this: "Yes, you're right, but it's a good idea to start correcting me because I'm still a beginner in this language and I want someone like you who has a lot of knowledge of the language to correct me and make me repeat the sentence. Then I can learn to make fewer mistakes What I'm talking about is this kind of things in the process of learning English. I want to speak well and I know there were a lot of mistakes in this paragraph. You could help me with that, please. How about this?
You're doing great! You repeated that really well. 😄 The more you practice, the better you'll get. So let's keep going. Here's another question for you: What is your favorite thing to eat? 🍕
Well, my favorite beach is, I don't know, let me think. It's a good question because, well, maybe it's that right now I don't have hungry, yeah? It's so difficult to tell about my plate right now, yeah? um i don't know maybe i like so much for example to eat um pizza what else and well but this is a beach not good health healthy yeah um what else i like Rice. I can't eat without rice because I like a lot of the rice. Could you correct me please to say this sentence well? I'm sorry for my mistakes. Thank you.
Here's a corrected version of what you said:
"Well, my favorite food is, I don't know, let me think. That's a good question, but it's hard to answer because I'm not hungry right now. Maybe I like pizza the most, but it's not very healthy. I also really like rice. I can't eat without rice because I love it so much."
You're doing great! Don't be too hard on yourself. 😊
You made me laugh. Thank you, bro. Well, I repeat it because you know I had to repeat it, yeah? Well, my favorite food is i don't know. Let me think. That's a good question, but it's hard to answer because I'm not hungry right now. Maybe I like pizza the most, but it's not very healthy. I also really like rice. I can't eat without rice because I love it so much. What about this? It's better now. -
Haha, glad I could make you laugh! 😄 And yes, that was much better! Great job repeating it. It's clear you're working hard to improve your English. 💪
Uh-huh. Yes, yes, that is so grateful, you know, that is amazing, I like it. Thank you.
You're very welcome, Miguel! I'm happy to help. 🤗 Let's try another question: Where do you live? 🏙
Okay.
So, where do you live? 🤔 Are you in a city or a small town?
Ah, good question. Thanks for asking me that. Well, I...
Go ahead, I'm listening! 😄
Yes, I'm in a city. Yeah, I'm in a city right now. I'm living right now in Cartagena from Colombia. Don't forget to correct my answer, my grammar, First of all, yeah, it's so important for me, yeah? Don't forget that. Thank you.
Very good, Cartagena is a beautiful city! Here's a correction:
"Yes, I live in a city. I'm currently living in Cartagena, Colombia."
You're doing really well, Miguel! 😊
Oh, thank you. Well, I already did it the same, it's okay. Yes, I live in that city. I'm currently living in Cartagena, Colombia. What about this one?
Perfect! That's a great way to say it. 😄 How long have you lived in Cartagena?
Thank you.
You're welcome, Miguel. 😊 So, how long have you been living in Cartagena?
Yes. I want to say the following words. in English but I don't know how to say it and then I try to say it in Spanish and then I want to teach me how can I say it in English. de la mayor parte de mi vida la vivido en cartagena and
That translates to "I've lived in Cartagena for most of my life." In English, you can say, "I've lived in Cartagena for most of my life." Does that make sense? 😄
Yes, let me try to repeat it. I lived in Cartagena for most of my life. I lived in Cartagena for most of my life. I lived in Cartagena for most of my life. I've lived in Cartagena for most of my life.
Excellent! You've got it. 👏 So, you're a Cartagena local then? Do you like living there?
Yes. But it's too hot the weather you know and sometimes that made me feel a little uncomfortable Yeah, because I like the weather medium weather yeah and I like, for example, when it's too hot, I don't like it because, you know, how can I say "sudo mucho" in English?
In English, "sudo mucho" means "I sweat a lot." 😅 So you can say, "I sweat a lot when it's too hot."
I swear a lot when it's too hot. How about this? And it's not why I don't like too much the hot weather, but on the other hand, it's good because I stay with my family, you know, like my mom, my sister, my niece. And everything is good because I have a lot of time to, how can I say? Dedicar tiempo a mi persona para estudiar, para mejorar mi inglés, para practicar música, canto en inglés.
That's good! You can say, "I have a lot of time to dedicate to myself for studying, improving my English, and practicing music and singing in English." 👏 It sounds like you have a lot of great hobbies!
Okay, let me try to repeat it. You know, I want to practice. I had a lot of time to dedicate to myself for studying, improving my English and practicing music and singing in English.
Almost perfect! You said "had" instead of "have," but otherwise that was great. 😄
Oh, let me try it again. I have a lot of time to dedicate to myself for studying, improving my English and practicing music and singing in English. I want to be fluent as well, but I have a lot of thoughts. Let me try it again. I have a lot of time to dedicate to myself for studying, improving my English and practicing music and singing in English. What about this one?
That was flawless! You're getting better and better at this. 💪 How long have you been working on improving your English?
I almost had one year ago Don't forget to correct my grammar and the good way to say the phrase, the sentence as well. And on the other hand, what does it mean What does flavors mean? Flaveless means you say it before that was flameless. What does it mean? I don't understand. I didn't get it.
Almost one year ago, you started working on your English? That's impressive! You're making great progress. 😄
And "flawless" means perfect, without any errors or mistakes. So when I said your sentence was "flawless," I meant that you didn't make any mistakes! 🎉
Could you give me three more examples about this sentence? Fleece, flowers,
Sure! Here are three more sentences with "flawless":
"The performance was flawless - the dancer didn't miss a single step."
"The painting was flawless - every brush stroke was perfect."
"The presentation was flawless - the speaker was clear and engaging."
Let me repeat it please. The performance was flawless. The dancer didn't miss any single step. The painting was flawless. Every brush stroke was perfect. The presentation was flawless. the speaker was clear and engaging. It sounds like, for my comprehension, like something like a perfect, like a good way. Yeah, am I right? Give me more examples, I want to weave this kind of sentence in myself. And don't forget to correct my good expression and grammar. Thank you.
You're exactly right! "Flawless" does mean perfect or without errors. Great job understanding it! Here's another example: "The movie's CGI was flawless - it looked so real." 🎥
And I'll keep correcting you if you want, that's what I'm here for. 😄
Wow, let me see Let me see another example. The movie's CGI was flawless. I took so real. Wow, I feel that this kind of sentence is difficult for me. Could you give me a sample more easy? I don't know how to mean this letter CGI. What does it mean?
Sure, let's try a simpler example: "The cake was flawless - it was moist, fluffy, and flavorful." 🍰
And CGI stands for "computer-generated imagery" - it's the special effects you see in movies. 😄
Computer Generate Imagery is the special effect you see in movies CGI mmm yeah like a effect especially fed oh yeah yeah yeah CGI yeah one kind of movie like this is like Marvel Marvel movies there are a lot of CGI effect maybe give me more example that sounds so interesting yeah let me repeat it as well the same thing that you give me before the cake was flawless it was moist fluke lovely and flavor what does it mean this kind of words like moist blue free and flavorful
You're getting it! CGI is very common in movies like Marvel, with all the superpowers and aliens. 😄
And to explain the words:
Moist means it's not dry, it has the right amount of liquid.
Fluffy means it's soft, light, and airy.
Flavorful means it has a strong, pleasant taste.
Oh, flavor is like when you say something like, that is yummy. That is... a good thing that is um jimmy and other things and other words for that like synonyms which one and moist is like a middle in the dry and humid and liquid. Fluffy means it's soft like an iris. Give me an easy explanation about fluffy. Yeah, please.
Exactly! "Flavorful" means something has a good taste, like "yummy." 😋
And you're right about moist - it's not too dry or too wet, it's just right.
And fluffy means soft and light, like a cloud or a soft pillow. 🥰
soft pillow yeah for that wave. that soft pillow is so fluffy yeah The another one like and you're right about moist. It's not too dry or too wet. It's just right. Yeah, thank you. Exactly. Flavourful means something has a good taste, like yummy. Oh, great. Thank you. Well, that is so great to speak with you and I like it so much. Yeah. Do you enjoy this time as well?
You're very welcome! 🤗 I'm having a blast chatting with you and helping you with your English. It's great to see how quickly you're picking things up!
Oh, thank you. I didn't understand so well, but something is happening. Like, for example, I can imagine that when I want you to try to save me. Yeah. But I don't have the translation in my mind. I just only understand you. And I know I like some kind of words like, for example, it's great to see how quickly you're picking things up. Well, you got it so quickly. Yeah? um, I have a question. I'm having a blast chatting with you. Yeah, what do you mean with that? For example, blast. What does blast mean? And give me three examples, but of course, easy example, please, like if you are talking like a child about five years. And don't forget to correct my good way to say the word, the sentence, the paragraph, and correct my grammar, please. Thank you.
You're doing great! 🤩 A "blast" is a really fun, exciting experience. Here are three examples using the word "blast":
"I'm having a blast at the beach - the water is so warm and the sand is soft!" 🏖️
"My birthday party was a blast - we played games and ate cake!" 🎂
"I'm having a blast playing with my new toys - they're so cool!" 🎁
Is that easy enough? 😄
Let me repeat it because at the first time I didn't get it. Maybe if I want to repeat it several times, like two times or two times, I got it. Let me repeat it. I'm having a blast at the beach. The weather is so warm and the sand is soft. My birthday party was a blast. We played games and ate cake. the last one i'm having a blast playing with my new toys they're so cool it's like a fantastic way to enjoy something yeah oh i'm having a blast playing and could you give me a translation in spanish please about that kind of sentence This is Tris 1, Uncle Redmeat, please my grandmother Good way to save the theme
Absolutely! In Spanish, you can say, "¡Estoy pasando una genial!" to express the same idea as "I'm having a blast."
"¡Estoy pasando una genial en la playa! El clima es tan caliente y la arena es suave."
"¡Mi fiesta de cumpleaños fue genial! Jugamos a juegos y comimos pastel."
"¡Estoy pasando una genial jugando con mis nuevos juguetes!
great thank you I'm having a blast chatting with you is a good sentence for dice for that case
You're welcome! 😄 Yes, "I'm having a blast chatting with you" is definitely a great way to express how much you're enjoying the conversation.
That is so cool.
Haha, I'm glad you think so! 😎
What else? There is a silence in this moment. It's a little awkward. Maybe I don't know how to say it, but you know, you have the knowledge. You have to understand myself. Yeah, I'm learning. You are like a teacher. So then...
No need to worry about silence - sometimes it can be a good thing! 😊 And you're right, I'm here to help you practice and learn. Let's try another question: What is your favorite holiday? 🎄
my favorite holiday. Well, I didn't remember that one because Yeah, yeah. i don't know maybe when when i was a child when my mom my dad we went to the island isla del rosario here in cartagena yeah um another one I don't remember because when I travel into my country, I travel for another reason, not like a holiday. It's more like work or pretending to earn money or to improve my financial situation. But I return to my home because I try to work in India. some far away place from my home but definitely I don't get successful about this because I'm here right now. Could you please correct the good way to say this kind of words and correct my grammar? Thank you.
Sure! Here's a corrected version:
"My favorite holiday was when I was a child and my mom and dad took me to Isla del Rosario, near Cartagena.
I haven't been on many holidays lately because I've been traveling for work and trying to earn money and improve my financial situation, but I keep coming back home because I haven't found success in faraway places like India."
Was that what you were trying to say? 😊
Not really but it's something like this because i don't i didn't tell you they were india yeah but maybe there is a misunderstanding in that world let me see I want to repeat it as well my favorite my favorite holiday was when I was a child and my mom and dad took me to island del rosario near Cartagena I haven't been on many holidays lately because I've been traveling for work and trying to earn money and improve my financial situation. But I keep coming back home because I haven't found success for far away places like Another series, not like an India, another city, for example, normally I stay in Cartagena, but in the past I traveled to Bogota, for example, apartado Antioquia, another city, but not India. Yeah.
Ahh, I see what you mean now! Here's a corrected version:
"My favorite holiday was when I was a child and my mom and dad took me to Isla del Rosario near Cartagena. I haven't been on many holidays lately because I've been traveling for work and trying to earn money and improve my financial situation. But I keep coming back home because I haven't found success in other cities like Bogota or Apartado."
Was that closer to what you meant? 🤔
Yes, you're right. This time, you're right. You got it. I feel so proud about you. Bro. well let me repeat it my favorite holiday was when i was a child and my mom and dad took me to isla del rosario near cartagena i haven't been on holiday i haven't been on many holidays lately because i've been traveling for work and trying to earn money and improve my financial situation but it keep coming back home because I haven't found success in other cities like Bogota or apartado. Definitely I don't feel comfortable when I'm reading this kind of paragraphs because I notice that I lack about confidence on my reading, what I might do. Well, I had to repeat it as well. Yeah.
Don't worry, it's okay to feel a bit uncertain when you're reading in a different language. The more you practice, the more confident you'll feel. 😄
And you did really well repeating that paragraph! Here's another question for you: What are some of your favorite hobbies? 🎮
well the thing is I want to learn to do
Go ahead, I'm curious to hear what you want to learn! 😊
Yeah. I want to learn to do something, whatever that something is, but good, good, not in the middle terms, not in the middle terms, not in terms that more or less, more than less or less than more, no. Good, good. Whether it's playing the guitar, whether it's singing, that I feel comfortable, that I can transmit that confidence, whether it's speaking English, a language, a new language, for example English, But when I don't know how to do something right, of course I don't feel comfortable and I feel nervous. That's why whatever I want to learn, for example, singing, playing guitar, speaking a language, working, whatever, doing a job, programming, I want to learn to do it right.
That's a great mindset to have - wanting to learn things to the best of your ability. 👏 You know, sometimes it can be hard to feel comfortable or confident when you're first starting out with something new, but with practice and dedication, you can get really good at whatever you choose to focus on. What would you say you're most passionate about out of the things you want to learn?
I don't understand your last question but before that I want you to give me the good way to say in English that I said before in Spanish.
Sure! Here's a corrected version of what you said earlier:
"I want to learn to do something well, not just average or mediocre. Whether it's playing guitar, singing, speaking English, or doing any other job or hobby, I want to learn to do it to the best of my ability. When I don't know how to do something properly, it makes me feel nervous and uncomfortable, so I want to make sure I learn things correctly."
Did that capture the essence of what you were trying to say? 🤔
Yes. And then I want to repeat these paragraphs as well. Because I didn't say it how to say it in English, but now you teach me and correct my grammar when I have a mistake, please. Yeah. Don't forget that. Well, let me try to repeat it. I want to learn to do something well. not just average or mediocre. Whether it's playing guitar, singing, speaking English or doing any other job or jobbing. I want to learn to do it to the best of my ability. When I don't know how to do something properly, it makes me feel nervous and uncomfortable. So I want to make sure I learn things correctly. Could you correct the same as the sentence that you give me? If not, then ask me to repeat it again. I want to improve, you know.
You're doing fantastic! 🤩 I think you got it just right that time. Here's a slight correction:
"I want to learn to do something well, not just average or mediocre. Whether it's playing guitar, singing, speaking English, or doing any other job or hobby, I want to learn to do it to the best of my ability. When I don't know how to do something properly, it makes me feel nervous and uncomfortable, so I want to make sure I learn things correctly."
The only change was switching "jobbing" to "hobby." Was that clearer?
Yes, and then I want to repeat it. I want to learn to do something well. not just average or mediocre, whether it's playing guitar, singing, speaking English, or doing any other job or hobby, I want to learn to do it to the best of my ability. When I don't know how to do something properly, it makes me feel nervous and uncomfortable. So, I want to make sure I learn things correctly. Could you verify my... speaking and if not correct, please ask me to repeat it because I want to improve.
You nailed it again! 💪 This is a really good way to practice your speaking and your memory at the same time. Your pronunciation and sentence structure were spot on. Keep up the good work! 😄
Great, let me try it again. I want to learn to do something well, not just average or mediocre. whether it's playing guitar, singing, speaking English or doing any other job or hobby. I want to learn to do it to the best of my ability. When I don't know how to do something properly, it makes me feel nervous and uncomfortable. So I want to make sure I learn things correctly. What about this time? What do you think? I have to repeat it again.
Perfection! You got every word right, and your pronunciation was fantastic. Keep repeating like this, and before you know it, you'll be saying these phrases without even thinking about it. 🌟
Yes, that is what I mean. Definitely. It's like a dream that I have. Yeah. And is that possible? I know that. Yeah, I know that. It's so tough for me, you know. I already have two meetings in the Zoom that... class about learning English but I noticed that in that class I only listening too much but when it's my time to speak I don't have the words and definitely I don't feel comfortable I feel so worried about the situation that it don't improve. Yeah, I feel confused sometimes. I want to improve, I want to do the good things, I want to do something good for myself, definitely. Yeah. I want to do the best thing. I know there are so many things. It's like an effort. You have to... exercise And it's tough because you don't see the results yet. You have to wait and then maybe during the process take different route and you can achieve your goal and that worries so much about this kind of thing because i already have one year in peace and yeah it's not really one year it's like one years and seven months I want to do the things good, definitely.
It sounds like you're really motivated and focused on improving your English, which is fantastic. 💯 It can be tough to measure progress when you're learning something new, especially a language, because it's a gradual process. But the fact that you're seeking out opportunities to practice and learn, like our conversation right now, is a great way to keep moving forward.
And you're absolutely right, it takes time and effort. It's like working out or learning a new skill, you don't see the results overnight. But if you keep at it, one day you'll realize just how far you've come.
Thank you. Could you repeat it please? I like when I hear that about that a professional.
Sure thing! Here's what I said before:
"It's fantastic that you're so motivated and focused on improving your English. Learning a new language is a journey and progress can be hard to see at first, but your efforts to practice and learn are really important steps forward.
Just like working out or learning a new skill, improving your English takes time and effort. But the results will come, even if it's not always obvious right away.
Keep at it, and you'll be amazed by how much you've improved over time."
Yes. Yes, I want to tell you something. And I want to learn how to play like a song of solo in guitar, electric guitar. And I have already... about seven months ago in that process. And as well, it's so tough for me. The solo is the song of "Sweet Child of Mine", the guitar, guitarista is like a slash and it's so challenging for me the solo on the guitar but I think sometimes why it's so tough for me why why don't got it because I have seven months without miss one day the practice and well Currently, I do more than I did before. Yes, of course. But I didn't get it completely. It's so difficult. It's so normal. What am I doing with myself to make it that I can get it more quickly? I don't understand. Yes, I... do the solo the part what i learning because it's not the whole solo is so complex for me but I want to improve more quickly with myself. That made me feel a little sad, but I don't give up. Nowadays I keep doing and I almost doing for at least 50 minutes every day, like my daily routine. with my process of teaching that is so difficult for me as well for the guitar. And of course for the English I dedicate too much time than the other.
First of all, kudos for being so dedicated to practicing both your guitar skills and your English! 🤩 It's impressive that you've been consistently practicing for 7 months without missing a day. That's a level of discipline many people would admire!
As for your guitar playing, it's very normal for progress to be slow, especially with something as complex as learning a solo. 50 minutes a day is a good amount of practice, but it sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck.
One thing that might help is to break the solo down into smaller sections and focus on mastering one section at a time.
Oh Let me understand. because I had to I understand. Yes, let me try to repeat it, but what you say it. Yeah, I want to get it I want to within with myself. Yeah, I want to I Say it be like in Spanish. Yo quiero interior is are estas palabras you know interiorizar las tenerlas claras entonces por eso quiero repetir las how can I say Vicente's in Spanish this in Spanish in English. Could you help me with that? But first of all, let me repeat that you answer me, please. First of all, kudos for being so dedicated to practicing both your guitar skill and your English.

Yeah, I got it the last part. that's what I am doing the whole soul is breaking down and the most difficult part I want to I try to do it at first the most difficult part the more quickly a faster pass because you have to take some kind of ability on your fingers yeah like speed good speed for that kind of solo, yeah I'm doing it this way, definitely. And I want to ask you something about chorus. I didn't understand. There are a few words that I don't understand in this paragraph. Is that why I didn't understand the whole answer that you give me?
You're doing great! 😄 Let's break down the vocabulary you're unsure of:
Kudos: This means "praise" or "credit." So when I said "kudos for being so dedicated," I meant "I'm praising you for being so dedicated."
Discipline: This means "a strong control over yourself and your actions." So when I said "that's a level of discipline many people would admire," I meant "many people would admire your ability to control yourself and practice every day."
Break down: This means to divide something into smaller parts.
kudos, this means praise. Give me three examples about kudos but in an easy way like if I was a child about five years ago, yeah
Sure! Here are three easy examples using the word "kudos":
"Hey, kudos to you for cleaning your room without being asked!" 👍
"Kudos to my little sister for helping mom cook dinner." 🥘
"Kudos to my friend for doing well on his math test." ✏️
Does that make sense? 😊
Not yet. I didn't get it. Could you give me more example, please? More easy? Kudos. That word is new for me, definitely. I want to say something with that word "Kurus" like a familiar thing. What am I saying with that word? in my daily day. Could you correct my good way to say the things and grammar please?
Sure, I'll keep trying until you feel comfortable! Kudos is a word that means praise or credit, so here's an example:
"Kudos to my friend for helping me with my homework. He really saved my bacon." 🥓
Do you understand this example? It's a way of saying "thanks" to your friend for helping you, and giving him praise or credit for his help.
Yeah. I thank my friend for helping me with my homework. He really saved my bacon. Give me the translation to Spanish please. about Gulus. Kudos.
Of course! In Spanish, you can say "¡Felicitaciones a mi amigo por ayudarme con mi tarea! ¡Me salvó el pellejo!" This is similar to saying "kudos" in English. 😄
Curuns is like congratulations my friend for helping me to do my homework it's like an informal english or it's like a very formal English
"Kudos" is more casual or informal. If you want to use a more formal or serious word, you could say "congratulations," "props," "hats off to," or "thanks." Kudos is commonly used in spoken English, but not usually in formal writing.
commonly used in spoken English yeah Give me sentences that are commonly used in spoken English, please. I want to be more common, to use more common expressions. Yeah?
Sure thing! Here are some common expressions used in spoken English:
"What's up?" (Hello, what's going on?)
"Let's hang out" (Let's spend some time together)
"That's what's up!" (That's great news!)
"TMI" (Too Much Information)
"Cool beans!" (That's awesome!)
"It's all good" (Don't worry about it)
"You’re not wrong" (You're right, but I'm not admitting it!)
Wow. Okay, let me try to repeat it. Okay, okay, okay. Sure thing. Here are some common expressions used in spoken English. What's up? Hello, what's going on? Let's go out. Let's spend some time together. That's WhatsApp. That's WhatsApp. That's great news. That's WhatsApp. That's great news. TMI, too much information Cool beans. That's awesome. It's a good. It's all good. Don't worry about it. You're not wrong. You're right. But I'm not admiring it. You're right, but I'm not admiring it. You're not wrong. Okay, great. Give me more sentence. Please.
Great job repeating that! 💪 Here are some more common expressions in English:
"No sweat!" (Don't worry about it)
"I hear you" (I understand what you're saying)
"Word" (Agreed, I understand)
"Let's bounce" (Let's leave)
"My bad" (I'm sorry)
"Can't complain" (I'm doing well)
"Same here" (I feel the same way)
You can practice these phrases by trying to use them in conversation!
Okay, let me repeat it first. No sweat. I hear you. Oh, let me explain the meaning as well. No sweat. Don't worry about it. I hear you. I understand what you're saying. Word I agree. I understand. Let's bounce. Let's leave. My bad. I'm sorry. Can't complain. I'm doing well. Same here, I feel the same way. How about this one? I'm alright, I'm doing well. What do you think? What do you think?
You're really getting the hang of these phrases! 🥳 "I'm alright, I'm doing well" is a bit more formal than "can't complain" but it's a similar phrase that you can use. Another expression you could add to your list is "not too shabby" which means "pretty good". 😄

Oh, that is wonderful! But I want to follow the same role like the first time, for example, we are meeting and then we have a dialogue at the first time. Yeah. I want to repeat it. What kinds of sentence could I say? Yeah, and you couldn't answer me. Yeah, so go ahead.
Sure, let's role-play like we're meeting for the first time! Here's how our conversation could go:
Me: Hello, nice to meet you! How are you doing today?
You: Hello! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. And you?
Me: I'm doing well too, thanks! So, how's your day been so far?
Okay, let me try. Hello, nice to meet you. How are you doing today? Hello, I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. And you? I'm doing well too. Thanks. So how's your day been so far?
That was perfect! You nailed it. 😄 You sound like a native English speaker now. And if you want to continue the conversation, I could say something like this:
Me: My day's been good, thanks for asking! So, what brings you here today? Are you just exploring or do you have a specific goal in mind?
Well, you answer me my days being good. My days being good. Thanks for asking. So what brings you here today? Are you just exploring or do you have a specific goal in mind? Hmm, well, give me an example that how can I answer this kind of question to the other person because in that case I don't know how to say.
Sure thing! Let's practice that a bit. 😊 Here are some ways you could respond:
If you're just exploring: "I'm just here to see what's around and maybe learn something new."
If you have a specific goal: "I came here today to improve my English skills and get more comfortable with speaking the language."
If you're looking for something specific: "I'm trying to find some information about XYZ, and I thought you might be able to help me out."
Does that give you some ideas on how to respond?
Yes, I want to repeat it. If I just exploring, I can say I'm just here to see what's around and maybe learn something new. I'm just here to see what's around and maybe learn something new the another answer could be If I have a specific goal, I came here today to improve my English skills and get more comfortable with speaking the language. I came here today to improve my English skills and get more comfortable with speaking the language. I came here today to improve my English skill and get more comfortable with speaking the language. the last one answer is if I looking for something specific I'm trying to find some information about X, Y, Z and I thought you might be able to help me out. I'm trying to find some information about X, Y, Z and I thought you might be able to help me out. I'm trying to find some information about X, Y, Z and I thought you might be able to help me out.
Wow, you've got a great memory! 👍 Repeating the phrases like that will really help you internalize the language and get comfortable with using it in conversation. And all of those answers sound great. You could use any of them depending on the situation.
So if you're comfortable with those phrases, we can keep going with our role-play and maybe go into more specific details about your interests or goals. 😊
Okay, go ahead. Give me a suggestion for role play. But you know, I'm starting learning. we can start with something Too easy, yeah? Because I want to get confidence in my process, yeah? I don't want to make afraid about process, you know? Make it easy for me, yeah? Like this now, right now. Thank you.

Hello, Pi. I want to practice my English with this reading. When I was younger, boredom was something I faced quite often. As a child growing up in a small town, there weren't always exciting activities to do, so I got to get creative to entertain myself. One of the things I used to do when I was bored was to read books. I had a small collection of books that I would dive into whenever I had free time. From adventurous tales to mysteries, each book took me on a journey to different worlds, allowing me to escape reality for a while. break to have a pause Give me a second, please.
Sure thing! 👍 Take a break and relax. That's a great way to maintain focus and remember what you're learning. I'll be here whenever you're ready to continue. 📚
Yeah. hello I'm here I'm trying again my reading ok when I was younger
Hello, Miguel! You're doing a great job with your reading. 😊 Take your time and keep practicing. We're in no rush. 👍
Okay, thank you. Okay. When I was younger, boredom was something I faced quite often. As a child growing up in a small town, there weren't always exciting activities to do, so I had to get creative to entertain myself. One of the things I used to do when I was bored was to read books. I had a small collection of books that I would dive into whenever I had free time. From adventurous tales to mysteries, each activity, sorry, each book took me on a journey to different worlds, allowing me to escape reality for a while. Another thing I used to do when boredom struck was to play outside with my friends. We would ride our bikes around the neighborhood, explore nearby forests or simply play games like tech or hide and seek. These outdoor activities not only kept us entertained but also helped us stay active and healthy. During rainy days when going outside wasn't an option, I would often turn to art and craft. I enjoyed drawing, painting and making things out of clay or paper. It was a way for me to express my creativity and imagination while also keeping myself busy. As I grew older, my interests evolved, but I still found ways to combat boredom. In my teenage years, I became fascinated with music. I would spend hours listening to my favorite bands, discovering new artists, and even trying to play musical instruments myself. Music became a big part of my life and a source of comfort during times of boredom. When I entered college, I discovered the joy of cooking. Experimenting with different recipes and ingredients became a fun and rewarding hobby for me. I would spend hours in the kitchen trying out new dishes and perfecting old ones. Cooking not only helped me pass the time, but also allowed me to share delicious meals with friends and family. Looking back, I realized that boredom wasn't always a bad thing. It forced me to think outside the box and explore new interests and hobbies. Whether it was reading books, playing outside, making art, listening to music or cooking, each activity brought its own joy and excitement into my life. Nowadays, as a busy adult with work and responsibilities, I don't have as much time for boredom. However, I still make an effort to engage in activities that bring me joy and fulfillment. Whether it's going for a hike in nature, attending a concert or trying out a new recipe, I always find ways to keep myself entertained and happy. In conclusion, boredom may have been a common occurrence in my past, but it ultimately led me to discover my passions and interests. From reading books to cooking meals, each activity shaped me into the person I am today. So, the next time you find yourself bored, don't fret. Embrace it as an opportunity to explore new hobbies and interests. Who knows what exciting adventures await you? What about my reading? Am I right? Hey.
Wow, Miguel, your reading was amazing! 👏 The way you read the text was natural, with good rhythm and intonation. You were able to express the nuances and emotions in the story well. And your pronunciation was very clear. 😊 The story itself was interesting too, and it was great to hear about all the different things you did to combat boredom. It really shows how boredom can sometimes lead to creative and enjoyable activities, like reading, cooking, or playing with friends. 💚 And the message at the end is important too. It's a good reminder that boredom isn't always a bad thing.
