Very well, let's have fun.​

Oh! I almost forgot, our mission. ok


2. Our Mission!!!

- Present information effectively, either personal experiences or others', in an engaging manner.
- Demonstrate appropriate use of all verb tenses.
- Identify the communicative function of reported speech and transition effectively and clearly.
- Use enough nouns, verbs, adverbs, and connectors to make the narration interesting.

And, of course, what we like the most, a lot of new vocabulary, among other things. But I'll stop here because it seems the mission is a bit lengthy, and I don't want to bore you. So let's get started right away.

Now we are ready to have fun!

Nikola Tesla was an inventor, electrical engineer, and physicist born in 1856 in Smiljan, in what is now Croatia, who played a crucial role in the development of electrical technology. He studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Graz and at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, but he left without completing his studies. He began working in the electrical industry in Budapest before moving to Paris to work at the Continental Edison Company. In 1884, he emigrated to the United States, where he briefly worked with Thomas Edison before establishing his own company.
Tesla is known for his pioneering work in the field of alternating current (AC) and for his rivalry with Edison over the electrical power distribution system. Tesla worked on numerous inventions and discoveries, including the induction motor, the Tesla coil, and the Tesla transformer. He is also credited with the development of radio technology and wireless energy transmission.
Throughout his life, Tesla was known for his eccentricity and his focus on pure scientific research. Although he made some significant contributions to electrical technology, Tesla died in poverty in New York in 1943, and much of his work and legacy were forgotten for many years before being rediscovered and recognized as fundamental to the development of modern technology.

Comments from third parties about Nikola Tesla during his lifetime.:
Robert Underwood Johnson described Tesla as a poet of science, as only the great can be, finding in creation a pleasure that satisfies the deepest needs of his being, seeing with clear eyes what others obscure, and hearing with pure ears what others deafen; George Westinghouse expressed his surprise at Tesla's ability to discover things that weren't even in the air, many of his inventions seem to arise out of nowhere, as if he had pulled them from the void; and Mark Twain described him as the most peculiar man he had ever known, conveying his enthusiasm for his plans and discoveries with such fire in his eyes that it infects others with his enthusiasm, being not only an inventor but also a visionary.

what is reported speech
The reported speech in this paragraph serves the function of informing, describing, and providing background information about Nikola Tesla. It transitions effectively by using different tenses to indicate past, present, and future aspects of Tesla's work and legacy.
Reported speech is a way of expressing what someone else has said without quoting their exact words. It is often used to report what someone else has said in the past or to summarize their statements. In the paragraph about Nikola Tesla, reported speech is used to convey the opinions of others about Tesla, such as Robert Underwood Johnson, George Westinghouse, and Mark Twain, as well as to provide factual information about Tesla's life and work. Reported speech is an important tool in writing because it allows writers to incorporate the perspectives of others and to provide evidence for their claims.
