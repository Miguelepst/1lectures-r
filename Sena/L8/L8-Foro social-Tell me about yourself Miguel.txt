Tell me about yourself Miguel
My introduction, for example, would be: 

Hi everyone, 
I'm Miguel, but it can be quite hard for people to pronounce, so feel free to just call me Mig.
I'm from Colombia, I'm colombian
I come from Cartago "Valle del cauca",  close to Perira
and I'm currently living in Cartagena Bolivar. 
I have lived in Cartagena since 1990.
I grew up with my parents and my sister.
I'm a single father, I have a 9 year old daughter and she just started learning English
like me. We're learning together and it's super exciting.
I run an education business
I'm self-employed
I enjoy swimming
I enjoy going to the gym
I love spending time with my family
I'm really into fitness
One thing that most people don't know about me is that I love throwing pre-parties in my apartment.
We get food, we have drinks on the balcony, and maybe play a drinking game or two.
I'm studying to become a english teacher
I am taking an English course on the internet

Hello, my classmates! It's a pleasure to greet you all. 
Here's my WhatsApp contact: +57 (312) 487-2877. 
I'd like to be your friend, just another friend, you know. 

Please feel free to let me know if there's any way I can help you with anything related to the course. 
Wishing you all a beautiful day ahead. Thank you.

Hi, my name is Kale.
I'm from Sweden, but I've lived in Colombia since 2019.
I run my own education business.
I am the founder of one of the fastest growing
English courses and communities in the world.
I love to watch and play football as well as going to the gym.
And one thing you may not know about me is
I occasionally love going to dinners with my friends and have
one too many shots of tequila and sing along with reggaeton and ranchera songs.
What about you?
