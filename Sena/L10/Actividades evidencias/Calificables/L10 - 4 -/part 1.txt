Understanding Key English Language Elements

In this task, we'll explore how to effectively use English to talk about life experiences, career transitions, and personal aspirations. We'll focus on:

1. Technical Vocabulary: Learn and apply words related to technology and work.
2. Modal Verbs: Practice using modals like could, should, must, and might in different contexts.
3. Hypothetical Situations: Use modal conjugations to discuss past possibilities and hypothetical scenarios.
4. Expressions of Wishes: Express future dreams and aspirations using phrases like "I would like to" and "I dream of."

Through these elements, we'll enhance your ability to narrate personal stories and reflect on experiences in English.
