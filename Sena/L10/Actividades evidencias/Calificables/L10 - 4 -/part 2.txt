Title: A Journey Through My Life and Work

Scene 1: Introduction
Miguel Gutierrez stands in front of the camera, smiling warmly.

Miguel: 
Hi, I'm Miguel Gutierrez, and today I'd like to share some stories about my life and work experiences. I hope you find them interesting and maybe even relatable.

Scene 2: The Beginnings
Cut to Miguel sitting in a cozy living room, holding an old photograph.

Miguel: 
I was born in Cartago, Valle del Cauca, but my family moved around quite a bit. We lived in Apartadó, Bogotá, and finally settled in Cartagena. My journey in technology began early. I graduated as a systems engineer from Simón Bolívar University in Barranquilla and later earned a technical degree in electronics.

Scene 3: The Workshop Years
Cut to a montage of Miguel working in his electronic technician workshop.

Miguel: 
For ten years, I ran my own workshop in Apartadó, servicing well-known companies like Almacenes Éxito, Hyundai, and Sankey. It was a fulfilling yet challenging time. I used to develop innovative solutions for various electronic problems. I remember one breakthrough when I managed to repair a complex device that seemed obsolete. It felt like magic, turning something old into something useful again.

Scene 4: Transition to Family Business
Cut to Miguel in the family store, interacting with customers and arranging products.

Miguel: 
After closing my workshop due to the economic downturn and the pandemic, I joined my family's variety store. We sell hardware and disposable food items. It was a significant change, but I adapted. Working with family can be both rewarding and challenging. We have to communicate effectively and support each other.
