Scene 5: Personal Stories
Cut to Miguel sitting at a dining table with family photos in the background.

Miguel: 
Family is everything to me. I live with my mother, sister, her daughter, and her husband in Cartagena. We share a close bond. There was this one time I saved two girls from drowning in the sea. It was a terrifying yet proud moment for me. It reminded me of the importance of being there for others.

Scene 6: Learning and Hobbies
Cut to Miguel playing the electric guitar and piano, and singing.

Miguel: 
Learning new skills is a big part of my life. I've been learning to play the electric guitar, trying to master "Sweet Child o' Mine" by Guns N' Roses. It's challenging but rewarding. I also play the piano, and singing is a daily routine. I'm currently working on hitting the high notes in "Wherever You Will Go" by The Calling.

Scene 7: Reflections and Future Aspirations
*Cut to Miguel looking thoughtful, with a view of the sunset behind him.*

Miguel: 
I've had my share of ups and downs, but each experience has taught me something valuable. I dream of traveling to the United States, having a partner who shares my passions, and continuing to learn and grow. With God's help, I believe anything is possible.

Scene 8: Conclusion
*Cut back to Miguel standing in front of the camera, smiling warmly again.*

Miguel: 
Thank you for listening to my stories. I hope they gave you a glimpse into my life and maybe inspired you in some way. Remember, every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Hasta luego!
