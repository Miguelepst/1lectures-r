Here are three minutes of Storytelling about what work situation

Hey everyone, let me tell you about Miguel Gutiérrez's work situation. It's been quite a journey for him. "If Miguel attends to the variety store, he sells hardware items". That's right, he's been working with his family in their variety store in Cartagena, selling hardware and disposable food items. But before that, "if customers visit Miguel’s workshop, he provides electronic repairs". Yes, he used to run his own electronics workshop in Apartadó, where he serviced well-known companies like Almacenes Éxito, Hyundai, and Sankey.
However, "if Miguel Gutiérrez had stayed in Apartadó, he would have continued running his electronics workshop successfully". Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and his workshop faced declining profits. "Miguel Gutiérrez must have faced a challenging work situation when he decided to close his electronics workshop in Apartadó due to declining profits and the impact of COVID-19 on his health and personal life". It was a tough decision, but he had to make it.
After closing the workshop, "Miguel Gutiérrez and his family were going to expand their variety store business to include more hardware items, but they decided to focus on selling disposable food items due to budget constraints. They had to adapt to the new situation. Everything is going well at work for Miguel Gutiérrez; he is managing his store efficiently and enjoying his time with his family". Despite the challenges, he's found a new rhythm.
"Miguel Gutiérrez might have considered returning to electronic repair work after closing his workshop due to declining profits and the impact of COVID-19". But he chose to focus on his family's store and his personal interests, like learning English and playing musical instruments. "In the end, Miguel Gutiérrez decided to leave his workshop and start working with his family in the variety store".
"To conclude, after several attempts to revive his workshop business, Miguel successfully transitioned to working with his family, ensuring the success of their variety store". It's been a change of pace for him, but he's making the most of it.
