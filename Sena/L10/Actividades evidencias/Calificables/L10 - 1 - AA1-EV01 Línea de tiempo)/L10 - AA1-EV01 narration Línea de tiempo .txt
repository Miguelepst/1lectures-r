Hi everyone, I'm Miguel Gutierrez, and I'm excited to share with you today.

I want to send a special greeting to each of you who are joining us from different places.

My heartfelt thanks to each of you for your time, dedication, and commitment to learning.

For those who don't know me yet, I'm Miguel Gutierrez, and today I have the honor of sharing my experience and knowledge with you on [Timeline - Past Situations with Future Projections (Vocabulary)].

Today, I present my evidence AA1-EV01, a video presentation about past situations with future projections using the right vocabulary. My name is Miguel Gutierrez, and I am a student in the online course 'ENGLISH DOES WORK - LEVEL 10' guided by our instructor Jenny Esther Robinson Archbold. 
This activity is part of our program at the educational institution SENA - Zajuna in Colombia, with a due date set for June 21, 2024. In this presentation, I will share past experiences and how they project my future, using examples and vocabulary learned in the course.

In this learning activity, we focus on the topic "How is everything going to be like?" We explore the third conditional, past modal verbs, and expressions to indicate the future in the past. My main goal is to create a graphic organizer in the form of a timeline where I narrate events and situations in chronological order, using photos and drawings to support me visually. I want to use the examples I learned in this component to communicate in English in a way that reflects my casual and everyday style, similar to how I express myself in my native language. Also, I want to apply this knowledge to my reality, by talking about my history, my present, and my future plans.

Now that we understand clearly what we need to do in this learning activity, it's time to start having fun and answering. Yes! Let's submit our answers now. So, let's have some fun!

Since I graduated as a Systems Engineer in 2005, my life has been full of challenges and achievements. University was an enriching experience that laid the foundation for my career. If I hadn't chosen to study Systems Engineering, I wouldn't have had the opportunities that came later.

13:
In 2008, I made a big decision: to open my own electronics workshop in Apartadó. This workshop, "Miguel Gutiérrez Services and Solutions," let me work with big companies like Almacenes Éxito, Hyundai, and Sankey. If I had known how successful my workshop would be, I would have opened it earlier.

On May 26, 2024, I had one of the most shocking moments of my life. I was at the beach in Cartagena when I saw two girls drowning. Without thinking, I jumped into the water and saved them. I thought, "if I hadn't acted quickly, those girls could have lost their lives." This event reminded me of the importance of always being ready to help others.

15:
Right now, I work in my family's store in Cartagena. This job lets me be close to my family and gives me time to practice English. If I didn't work in the store, I wouldn't have as much time to study English, which I think is really important for my future career.

16:
As I sit here in Cartagena, reflecting on my life's journey, regrets and missed opportunities come to mind. If I had been more decisive, I would have pursued my dream of establishing a national service center for electronic appliances, a business idea I once had. However, I hesitated, and the opportunity slipped away.

In casual English, the "cero condicional" refers to the zero conditional in English grammar. This conditional is used to express general truths, scientific facts, or situations that are always true if a certain condition is met. It typically follows the structure "if + present simple, present simple.
" For example, "If you heat ice, it melts."

18:
If I had known then what I know now, I would have approached the negotiations for the heat stations differently. Perhaps I could have secured a better deal and not missed out on a potentially profitable opportunity.

19:
In casual English,  the First Conditional refers to a grammatical structure used to talk about real possibilities in the future. It typically combines "if" with the present tense, and the future tense or imperative in the main clause. For example, "If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors." It's like saying, "If this happens, then that will happen."

In casual English, the Second Conditional is used to talk about hypothetical situations or unreal possibilities in the present or future. It typically follows the structure "if + past simple, would + base verb." For example, "If I had more money, I would travel around the world." It's about imagining what might happen if certain conditions were met, even though they may not be true in reality.

20:
Looking back, I realize that my fear of failure often held me back. If I had been more courageous, I might have explored new ventures and expanded my horizons beyond what I thought possible. These reflections on my past regrets and missed opportunities remind me of the importance of taking risks and seizing opportunities when they arise. It's never too late to learn from our regrets and strive for a better tomorrow.

21:
In casual English, the Third Conditional refers to a type of conditional sentence that talks about a hypothetical situation in the past and its possible outcome, which didn't happen. It's like saying, "If something had happened differently in the past, then something else would have happened as a result." 

For example, "If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam." It's all about imagining how things could have turned out if the past had been different.

Today we're going to look at how to use the third conditional in English. Let's see some examples to understand better how it works in different situations.

Once, I sold three heat stations for only 100,000 pesos. Later, I realized that I could have asked for more, but at that moment, I needed the money quickly.

On August 4, 1979, I was born in Cartago, Valle del Cauca. My family thought about staying there longer, but we ended up moving to Apartadó when I was one year old.

"I was born in Cartago, Valle del Cauca. It’s amazing to think about how everything has changed since then. Looking back, I realize that I have had some issues! But that’s all part of the journey.

Sequence linkers, also known as sequence markers or transitional words, are words or phrases used to guide readers through the progression of a narrative or argument. They help to organize the information in a logical order and indicate the relationships between different parts of a text. Some common sequence linkers include:

We've covered conditionals, past modal verbs, expressions for future in the past, sequence linkers, and expressing opinions. This knowledge helps us discuss regrets, plans, and opinions clearly and structured.

Now my question in this video is this: 
How do you think Miguel Gutierrez's key life experiences and decisions, such as his relocations and educational choices, have influenced the person he has become today?

So leave your answers below this video and remember, you have the best of the best.
