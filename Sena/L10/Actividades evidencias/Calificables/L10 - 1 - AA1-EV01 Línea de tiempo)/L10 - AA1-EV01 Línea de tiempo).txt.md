The Life of Miguel Gutierrez: A Timeline
Miguel Gutierrez was born on August 4, 1979, in Cartago, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The following year, his family moved to Apartadó, a small town where Miguel spent his early childhood. In 1983, the Perez family relocated to Cartagena, a city they called home for the next 15 years.
Miguel showed a keen interest in electronics from a young age. At 19, he graduated from an electronics technical school in Cartagena in 1994. Eager to further his education, Miguel completed a two-year electronics technician program at Centro Inca in Barranquilla in 1997.
In 1999, Miguel entered a common-law relationship with Marli in Cartagena, which lasted three years. During this period, he balanced his personal life with his studies and in 2002, he proudly graduated from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Barranquilla with a degree in systems engineering at 25.
Miguel continued to enhance his skills by completing a diploma in software engineering in 2005 while still studying systems engineering. His dedication paid off as he built a career in the tech industry.
In 2009, Miguel began another common-law relationship, this time with Alejandra in Apartadó. They stayed together for four years. By 2012, Miguel moved to Bogotá, where he lived for the next 22 years. During his time in Bogotá, Miguel returned to Centro Inca in Barranquilla and completed another two-year electronics technician program in 2017.
In 2018, Miguel moved back to Apartadó and lived there for 26 years. However, due to economic challenges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had to close his electronics workshop in 2020. This marked a difficult period in Miguel's life.
In 2021, at the age of 41, Miguel returned to Cartagena, where he started working in a variety store with his family. He continued to build a life in Cartagena, and in 2024, Miguel made headlines for saving two girls from drowning in the sea on May 26.
