v3:
Hi Nacho, I thought you were telling me that over there, there was a boy who was your friend. What I was telling you yesterday was, well, that there are children the same age as my son who don't say, well, almost anything. The neighbor lady, she gets very scared because Óscar David, well, he talks a lot, but in reality, Óscar David is a spark compared to any other child. Her child is three years old (36 months) and Óscar David is only 25 months old, so 2 years and 1 month. And Óscar David, if you ask him about colors, he tells you. He knows brown, he knows gray, he knows black, he knows white, he knows orange. I told him, I gave him an example: "Son, what color is that chair?" So, for me, it's what you call aquamarine blue. Then he says to me, "Mom, it's sky blue, it's sky blue," and for purple, he says it's violet. So, if you understand me, he has a capacity, I think he turned out very intelligent and expressive, like his dad, because his dad is like that, very methodical.

Ha Nacho, I thought you were telling me that there was a boy over there who was your friend. What I was telling you yesterday was that there are kids around my son's age who hardly say anything. The neighbor, the lady, stays very scared because Óscar David talks a lot, but in reality, Óscar David is a spark compared to any other child. Her child is three years old (36 months) and Óscar David is only 25 months old, which is 2 years and 1 month. If you ask Óscar David about colors, he will tell you. He knows brown, he knows gray, he knows black, he knows white, he knows orange. I told him, I gave him an example: "Son, what color is that chair?" So, to me, it's what one calls aquamarine blue. Then he says to me, "Mom, it's sky blue, it's the color sky blue." And when I mention purple, he says it's violet. So, you see, he has this capacity, I think he turned out very intelligent and expressive, maybe taking after his dad because his dad is very methodical.

He is very much a planner. He, for example, earns a certain salary and writes it down in a notebook. Then he starts deducting what he has to spend. For example, if he earns a million, he writes at the top: "salary one million, groceries three hundred thousand pesos." Then he keeps subtracting and subtracting until he tells me he only has ten thousand left. With that paper, he manages his budget for the pay period to see how much is left. I think he is like that too, in part Nacho. I believe that children are a reflection of their parents because if you don't teach them anything, they won't learn anything, and if you teach them bad things, they will learn them because they are like repeaters at that stage. I always talked to my son even when he was in the womb. When I got pregnant, there were many emotions - fear, sadness, joy - it was a mix of feelings.

Because I had already experienced a loss, and we didn't want the same thing to happen again. One always used to say, "What will happen after this date that comes next?" So, one becomes filled with a lot of fears. But then afterwards, there was a lot of happiness in knowing that this child would be with me and that I was the one giving life to him. When I sat down, so to speak, he started growing, and I used an app on my phone where my baby would grow every day. I would say to him, "My love, today you are this big." I called him my love, my son, my baby. Because I didn't know why everyone else said it would be a girl, a girl, the girl. But I never leaned towards a girl or a boy, I simply said it was a greatness that I had within me. So, I always used to sit with him, I would say, "Son, let's eat," but I wouldn't say, "Son, let's have lunch," I would say, "Son, let's have lunch."

The grandma made us rice, she made us fried meat, I hope she likes it a lot, we are going to eat together, ha, well, I used to tell her that, but the urge to vomit was immediate, and so I would talk to her, I would tell her I couldn't eat calmly, but I always sat there and from that moment on I started to talk to Him, when he grew up more, I would say son,
Where is my son, when he moved, I would say, he's happy, or I would say son, haa!!! And when I was going to shower because he became a hill for me, and I would say my love, we are going to shower, it's very cold, and he seemed to listen to me, and he seemed to curl up, I mean the bond between mother and son, I mean between Oscar David and I it always was and always will be, except they cut that bond when he was born, because they took him away to the incubator.

They took him to the neonatal ICU and they showed him to me like that, they said to me, "Mom, look, this is your son, we are going to take him, when the father comes, once he agrees with us, he will see him and we will tell him how he is, but he will be fine." They took him because Óscar David was born at 33 weeks, which was very early, and he needed to be in the incubator, so they left, I mean, that is an impressive story, it is very beautiful to me and... believe me... it is... now. Mmm! Furthermore, when he was a baby, I always looked at him and said: "Son, I can't believe it's you, you with me," and well, we have always talked, but I always wanted him to call me and say "mom," for his first words to be "mom," "hahaha," but unfortunately it did not happen that way, because he called his dad first and I used to say things to him with my mouth, I would say, "Son, I love you," or I would say, "Son, tell me mom," and that's why he learned to speak very quickly because I instilled all that in him.

Nacho, I taught him the colors, I taught him the numbers because he knows the numbers from 1 to 3 (yes, from 1 to 3). I taught him the colors of the flag, I taught him to call everything by its name, because something I've always done is that, to say here when he was growing up he was so attracted to bright colors and so on, but he wasn't speaking yet, for instance, there was a calendar here, so in that calendar, there were large fruits and vegetables on the wall. I always told him, for example, he would say, "mmm, mmm," like, mom, what is this? Even without speaking yet. So, if it had been another mom, I would have said, "Oh, nothing, just a calendar." But no! I said, "Look, son, this is a calendar, and what's here are the fruits. Each month has a different fruit, a different vegetable." So, I would say, "Look, this is the banana, this is the tomato, this is the pineapple, this is the wheat," and he started to internalize all that I always spoke to him using specific names, not leaving it in the limbo when he asked things. I believe that's where the importance lies in teaching children.


So, then as he was learning, he would say mmm, mmm, and I would say to him: yes, son, show me where the banana is, and he would point to it. And if you saw, he then learned to say banana, tomato, in short, all that. The first thing he said from the kitchen was "potato" because the potato was there. He used to say "mom, potato" and the potato was the food, lunch, everything. Now he says breakfast, now he says lunch, things like that. So I think the progress of this child, I mean, he has a very good capacity. But besides that, I think that one also gives them the capacity through learning. I mean, that's like the role one plays as a supportive figure. But, well, Nacho, I think not all people or parents do that, and besides, they have a child and see it as: "I got pregnant, what a mess." Unfortunately, but the meaning of being a mother is not that; it is something else, something much deeper, something nicer.

And really, the pain of a mother starts from the moment she conceives, I mean, from the moment she conceives the baby in her little stomach because, well, the truth is I went through a lot during pregnancy. There are people who, excuse my expression, vulgarly say that it's like passing a bun, well, I don't see it like that. It's much more complex, complicated, yes, things can get very complicated, tough! Tell me about it, I had labor pains starting from around 11 p.m. until the next day at 9:55 a.m., it was tough, really, because it's terrible, those pains, if you don't breathe, you'll abort. So, that's what I have to tell you. There are many things that have happened along the way, which are just another experience, but, really, it becomes very long. Oh, by the way, Oscar David's cousin took a long time to enter the garden. At the moment, she is almost 4 years old and can barely count to 10. I say that Oscar David, with everything he knows, can count up to 3 (1, 2, 3), and look, he's 25 months old, I say he catches up to her, because Oscar David is a little spark.

In every sense of the word, for good, something that leaves me very satisfied and content is that the truth is, he doesn't say the swear words that everyone else says, most people do, he doesn't say them, not at all. So that really depends on each individual, because if the parents, the family nucleus, are constantly using swear words, well, I believe that's where one learns. But this child, not a single swear word comes out, he doesn't say anything bad. So, not yet, let's hope that as he grows up, if he happens to hear them, he immediately forgets them. But yes, that's what I wanted to tell you, it's a pretty nice story. I hope you don't get bored listening to this very long voice message, but it's very interesting.

audio 2:
Ha Nacho and the other thing is, to give an example, I put on TV for him, right? But then, the TV that I put on for him is not those shows that teach things or anything like that, they are not series or anything like that. I put on a lot of little cartoons for him, but mostly like songs so they can teach him, I mean, to sing, like to give him a lesson. Then he tells me ”mom: the turuleca, what the turuleca hen”, he is currently learning to sing "the lola cow", the little chicks, well, not very well, but at least he already knows it. Another thing that I find very nice is that we agreed, Bairon and I, that when we were very focused on him, we wouldn't pick up the cellphone, and we wouldn't show him things on the cellphone so that he wouldn't become dependent on it, because that is deadly.

response:
Very interesting, cousin, thank you very much, definitely, if it is like that, it's as you say, yes, that's good, I congratulate you, that's right, no, and it's a reality as you say, there are other realities, there are other situations that are very different, and children grow up in an inadequate environment, but it's like a kind of: like, you have it, you have it very clear, like someone says like a seed, that seed needs to be watered, it needs to be nurtured, so, so, and so, until it strengthens, and that work at the beginning, is done a lot, of course, by the environment surrounding the child, well, cousin, thanks, I wanted to hear that again, may God bless you, I love you very much, take care a lot, I love you very much, and say hello to my aunt Gemita, take care, well, and to everyone over there, bye, well, behave yourself, you behave well, you are very well behaved, also with Bairon, please, a hug, bye.
