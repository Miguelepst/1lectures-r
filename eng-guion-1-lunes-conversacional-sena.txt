All of them are fellow participants from the previous class titled "Talking About Oneself," 
where they stood out with their active participation. 

I am thrilled to see what we will achieve together! 

Let's start this virtual journey together!

3. Provide Main Topic Context

First, let me give you a brief overview of the current subject. 

Sustainability refers to the maintenance of ecological, 
economic, and social resources and processes to meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own.

Simple truth, right? Yes, but crucial for our future generations. 

If we pay attention to this issue now, we will reduce the death of planet Earth. 
After all, who could live on a dead planet? Nobody, right?

4. Development:

a. Impact of Sustainability on Resource Conservation
      
How sustainability has changed the way we conserve resources:

By using resources more efficiently, we ensure their availability for future generations.

Mention examples of "sustainability":
      
Short example of Resource Conservation:
      
Turning off lights when leaving a room contributes to energy conservation, ensuring that electricity is available for other purposes and promoting sustainability for future generations.

   b. Sustainability Impact on Biodiversity Protection
      How sustainability has influenced biodiversity protection:
      Sustainability promotes practices that protect ecosystems, helping to maintain the variety of life on the planet.
      Mentioning the importance of sustainability in biodiversity protection:
      Biodiversity protection preserves species, ensures ecological balance, and promotes sustainability for future generations.      
   
   c. Impact of sustainability on improved human health

      How sustainability has transformed improved human health:
      Greener cities: By integrating parks, sustainable transportation, and ecological architecture, sustainability transforms urban environments towards environmental resilience.
      There are many examples, but I will mention only three examples of improved human health:
      - Renewable energy: The adoption of solar panels and wind turbines drives the transition towards more sustainable energy.
      - Ethical artificial intelligence: Developing fair and transparent algorithms ensures informed and socially responsible decisions.
      - Global connectivity: The expansion of high-speed networks facilitates instant communication and the exchange of information.

   d. Impact of sustainability on long-term economic stability
      Mention the recent developments in long-term economic stability due to sustainability:
      Investment in renewable energies drives sustainable growth, ensuring long-term economic stability.
      Mention the impact of sustainability on the future:
      **Promoted renewable energy:** The transition to sustainable sources ensures a cleaner and more efficient energy future.      

   e. Brief conclusion of items (a, b, c, d)
      Recalling what was mentioned earlier, we summarize the most important points in a very brief manner:
      a. Resource conservation: Efficient use of resources in sustainability to ensure future availability, for example, turning off lights to conserve energy.
      b. Biodiversity protection: Sustainability influences sustainable practices to preserve ecosystems and ensure a diversity of life in resource conservation.
      c. Improved human health: Sustainability transforms urban environments towards environmental resilience in improved human health, with examples such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence, ethics, and sustainable development.
      d. Long-term economic stability: Investment in renewable energy for long-term economic stability through sustainability drives sustainable growth to ensure future economic stability.

   f. Impact of sustainability on social cohesion
      Sustainable communities tend to be more inclusive and equitable, promoting social cohesion.
      Mentioning the importance of sustainability in social cohesion, I will only mention three examples, there are too many:
      - Sustainability strengthens equality, fostering peaceful coexistence and reducing social disparities.
      - Sustainable communities generate fair employment, building social ties and mitigating conflicts arising from economic inequalities.
      - Environmental awareness promotes shared values, creating a sense of collective responsibility and solidarity in society.

      Certainly, it's a very extensive and important topic as it has to do with sustaining the life of the only known living planet at the moment, hence its importance. It's a fact that if the Earth dies, our distant neighbor "the moon" won't be waiting for us with open arms to inhabit it.

      "The importance of sustainability lies in its balance between economic growth, environmental preservation, and social well-being, ensuring that we do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."

   g. Sustainability Visual Resources
      Slides, images, graphics:
      Search for resources: images

      Add a specific video on sustainability:
      Search for resources: 1 very short video with English subtitles.
      Reduce the playback speed and lower the volume of the original audio in the video. The idea in this case is for the presenter to read for the audience.

      Video: What is sustainability? | ACCIONA, duration: 1 minute and 43 seconds.

   j. Presentation Duration
      Mention five minutes as a minimum:
      
      Dear colleagues, please note that the minimum time we will dedicate to this conference will be five minutes.
      The maximum time will be determined by the instructor.
     
   k. Share a joke, tongue twister, with a touch of humor:

      Tongue Twister: (Quick repeaters repeat rough recyclers.)
            
      Would you like to try saying it quickly?
      in spanish is: "Rápidos repiten rudos recicladores."
      
      Remember, sustainability can also be fun.      
                          
   l. Glossary
      Define technical terms:
      'Open the floor'
      The phrase "open the floor" is frequently used in the context of a meeting or discussion 
      to invite people to start expressing their opinions, ideas, or comments. 
      It signifies the beginning of a period during which individuals are encouraged 
      to speak up and contribute to the conversation. 
      In Spanish, "Abre el espacio" conveys a similar meaning, 
      urging participants to share their thoughts or engage in the discussion.
