The Wrong Duck. 

Eddie is talking to a waitress at a restaurant. 

Is the food here good? It all looks...  really expensive. 

Yes, it's not cheap, but we're one of the best restaurants in town. 

Okay, I really want my date to like me. 

Are you sure she's coming? You've been waiting for an hour. 

She said to meet her at the Blue Duck at 7pm. 

Oh, this is the Black Duck. 

What? This isn't the Blue Duck. 

What? This isn't the Blue Duck? 

No, but the Blue Duck isn't far from here. 

Maybe she's still there"!" 

Eddie runs to the Blue Duck. He sees a waiter. 

Excuse me, did you see a tall woman with dark hair waiting here? 

Yes, but her date never arrived. 

I told her to go to the Black Duck. I think her date is there. 

Oh no"!" 

Eddie runs back to the Black Duck. 

His date is outside the restaurant. 

Georgia, I'm glad that I found you. Let's go eat.

The restaurant just closed. 

I'm so sorry. 

It's okay. Let's have burgers across the street. 

This place is too expensive anyway. 

I think I'm in love.
