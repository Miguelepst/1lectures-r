Additional Information About Me:
- Good son
- Affectionate lover in relationships
- Sentimental; certain movies can easily make me cry. I have another anecdote related to this topic from my time in university with my classmates, but I'll mention it later.
- Averse to pain; I dislike injections. I prefer taking a pill or syrup when I'm sick, but sometimes you just have to endure it.
- Not into extreme sports.
- No tattoos yet, but who knows in the future.
- Pierced my ears once, but currently don't wear earrings.
- Once grew my hair long, below my shoulders, when I was working in my own workshop in Apartadó¹.

## Education
- Graduated from university at 25 years old as a systems engineer from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Barranquilla.
- Graduated from electronics technical school at 19 years old.
- Completed a 2-year electronics technician program at Centro Inca in Barranquilla in 2017.
- Studied systems engineering in Barranquilla, graduating in 2005. Also completed a diploma in software engineering. The program lasted 11 semesters. I studied at night while helping my parents with their restaurant deliveries during the day. Initially, I wanted to study electronic engineering, but it was too expensive. Systems engineering was closely related to technology and could be useful for my work in electronics, such as creating algorithms for robots or robotic arms in factories. Ultimately, I graduated as a systems engineer from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Barranquilla.
- Learning new skills has been challenging and time-consuming for me. I haven't found any easy shortcuts; it's been a gradual process of persistence and effort. When I was between 15 and 30 years old, I often felt frustrated when learning new things².

## Places Lived
- Cartago, Valle del Cauca (first year of life)
- Apartadó (3 years)
- Cartagena (first lived here for 15 years, returned at age 41, and have been living here for 4 years now).
- Bogotá (3 years)
- Apartadó (12 years)


- Spent 3 years in Apartadó.
- Moved to Cartagena, where I've been living ever since.
- Lived in Bogotá for 22 years.
- Returned to Apartadó for 26 years.
- At age 41, I came back to Cartagena, and it feels more like home than any other city.

I spend my days at home, taking care of whatever needs to be done. As I mentioned earlier, my mother's house is divided into two parts: one is a business or store that sells various items to neighbors, and the other part is our living space—it's both a home and a business³.

## Relationships
- Common-law relationship with Marli (3 years)
- Common-law relationship with Alejandra (4 years)

At 23 years old, I had a common-law relationship with Marli in Cartagena that lasted three years.
At 30 years old, I entered a second common-law relationship with Alejandra in Apartadó, which lasted 4 years.

My thoughts on relationships:
Being single is fantastic, but being in a relationship is a challenge. For me, being alone isn't bad, but being in a partnership is a true test. I would like to have a partner again, and not having children is easier than having them—another challenge I'd like to experience. I dream of having two children. There was a time when being alone felt like a problem, but now I see

Work

- Electronics Technician with Own Workshop in Apartadó (10 years): I worked for well-known companies such as Almacenes Éxito, Hyundai, and Sankey. These companies were clients of my workshop.

- Current Work: I currently work with my family in a variety store that specializes in hardware and disposable food items.

- Details of Current Work: Our store sells a wide range of products, including disposable food containers, napkins, straws, screwdrivers, light bulbs, and electrical accessories like cables, switches, power outlets, and nails. It's like a mini hardware store. The store is located in our own home. I assist with sales and household tasks. Additionally, I use the free time my job provides to attend virtual meetings or classes to practice and learn English. Of course, I also spend a lot of time with my family.

- Products Sold in the Hardware Store: Some of the items we sell include electrical tape, tools like screwdrivers and measuring tapes, and various electrical accessories for homes, such as light switches, power outlets, and light bulbs. We also offer consumables for food packaging and even paintbrushes. It's truly a diverse range of products².


Hobbies and Interests

- Hobbies:
    - Singing
    - Playing the guitar
    - Playing the piano
    - Listening to music
    - Dancing
    - Going to the gym
    - Learning English

- Interests:
    - Traveling to the United States: I want to visit all those famous places I've seen on television since I was a child.
    - Having a Girlfriend from the United States or Asia Who Speaks English: I also like women from China and Japan, but they must know English because I don't plan to learn another language. With God's help, I'll learn to speak English.
    - Continuing My Programming Learning Process: English is another tool that will help me in this process. Currently, I've paused it because I feel that doing too many things at once doesn't yield good results. I hope to reach a good level of English proficiency so I can resume my learning process without letting go of English. I also hope to generate more income as a virtual programmer. I understand that programmers earn well, and knowing English can boost their earnings even more. The good thing is that when you truly understand something, it becomes easy. It doesn't require much effort, and it's even fun to get paid a lot of money for it. The problem arises when you don't fully understand it or only have partial knowledge. That state is challenging. It takes a toll on you.
    - Childhood Dream of Going to Japan: As an adult, I learned that there are many earthquakes there, so I'm not very interested in going anymore.

- Short-Term Goals:
    - Generating Income with English: I want to work as an English teacher, starting from basic levels (A1, A2), and as my English proficiency improves, I'd like to teach more advanced levels or engage in other virtual activities that leverage my English skills. Ideally, I'd like to work from home or any location without needing to commute to an office. For example, if I have to travel to the United States, I'd like to be able to work remotely from there.
    - Preferences in a Partner:
        - Educated
        - Respectful
        - Grateful for life
        - Unable to hide her feelings of love for me, even when she's angry
        - Youthful spirit (if she's young, even better)
        - Physically attractive (slim, with a guitar-shaped body, beautiful face, eyes, smile, and a nice figure)
        - Sexually active but faithful
        - English-speaking (either from an Asian background or a native of the United States)
        - Has ample time for family and isn't overly consumed by work.



Other Preferences: Food and Daily Routines

- Food Preferences:
    - I like rice; it's very common to eat rice every day. I also enjoy eggs and beef, although not every day.
    - Some à la carte dishes I really like are:
        - **Bandeja Paisa**: An emblematic dish of Colombian cuisine, typical of the Antioquia region and representative of Colombia. It consists of an abundant combination of ingredients, including beans, white rice, beef, pork rinds, fried egg, chorizo, ripe plantain, avocado, arepa, and hogao. Known for its variety of flavors and textures, it's a substantial and traditional option in Colombian cooking. The Bandeja Paisa reflects the culinary richness and regional tradition of Colombia.
        - **Cazuela de Mariscos**: A seafood casserole.
        - **Bandeja Paiza**: Similar to Bandeja Paisa, but with slight variations.

- Climate Preference:
    - I prefer moderate climates; extreme heat or cold isn't my preference.

- Electronics Passion:
    - At one point, I was passionate about electronics. My email address, miguelepst@hotmail.com, stands for "Empresa Provedora de Servicios Técnicos" (Technical Services Provider Company). It was like a health insurance company for appliances, which also have a lifespan. I envisioned a national company with branches across Colombian cities, serving many clients. Unfortunately, I couldn't fully realize this idea. I had a workshop providing warranty services in Apartadó, Antioquia, for 10 years. However, economic challenges arose, and the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation. I faced health risks three times, and a neighbor, unfortunately, succumbed to COVID-19. Being far from my family, I relied on the goodwill of a neighbor during my third illness. Eventually, I closed the workshop, settling all client matters first.

- Learning Guitar and Piano:
    - Electric Guitar: I practice daily to play the solo from "Sweet Child o' Mine" by Guns N' Roses, performed by guitarist Slash. It's quite challenging, involving technical skills like speed, precision, finger strength, hand coordination, and auditory ability for different effects. I haven't fully mastered it yet, but I'm committed to practicing 15 minutes daily, sometimes extending to half an hour or an hour once a week.
    - Piano: I've learned to play a song in this activity. After six months, I can play it without looking at the keyboard. The song is "Un Mundo Ideal" by Venezuelan singer Ricardo Montaner, from Disney's "Aladdin." Now I spend about 5 minutes playing it, using it for vocalization exercises.

- Learning to Sing:
    - I dedicate 15 minutes daily to singing. My current challenge is hitting high notes in most songs I like. I'm learning to sing "Wherever You Will Go" by The Calling. My goal is to master one song, and this one is a favorite. I appreciate the melody and the singer's voice. It's a nostalgic rock-pop ballad.

- Learning English:
    - Before bed, I watch YouTube channel "Aprendiendo Inglés con Películas" (Learning English with Movies) for 20 to 30 minutes. Additionally, I spend over 4 hours daily practicing through apps, virtual classes, and conversations.
    - I've completed two English series: "Futurama" and "Friends." Currently, I'm watching "American Dad." Afterward, I turn off the TV and go to sleep.
    - My philosophy is to learn difficult things and make them easy, maintaining that level with minimal time investment. When I'm stable, I take on new challenges to strengthen my skills.

- Daily Routine:
    - I wake up at 6 am (unless I stayed up late the previous night). As I'm committed to learning English, I listen to English news on my phone while still in bed.
    - After some stretching, I shower, dress, and visit my mother next door. There, I use Duolingo to practice English, including three exams: one to advance to a higher level, one to achieve gold status in completed lessons, and one to review and correct errors. I always start with the listening and pronunciation section to maintain my daily streak. I've maintained a 683-day streak, which is significant considering Duolingo's user base.
    - I do this while waiting for breakfast. Sometimes my mother prepares it; other times, we buy it from a neighbor. My usual breakfast includes eggs, bread, or plantain slices, along with a cup of coffee.


## Favorite Food
    - Rice (consumed daily)
    - Eggs
    - Beef
    - Bandeja Paisa
    - Seafood casserole

    I know how to cook rice.
    I can cook eggs.
    I can prepare plantain slices.
    I can cook beef.
    I've also made beans, but I might have forgotten how; it's been a while since I've been in the kitchen. The same goes for soups.
    However, I'm not a big fan of cooking.

    I enjoy rice; it's very common to eat rice every day. I like eggs and beef, although not every day.
    À la carte dishes I really enjoy:
    - **Bandeja Paisa**: An emblematic dish of Colombian cuisine, typical of the Antioquia region and representative of Colombia.

## Pets
    - A parrot named Paco (accidentally arrived 7 months ago)
    I currently have a pet: a small parrot named Paco. My mother is Paco's grandmother, and I'm Paco's uncle. The whole family has a familial relationship with this parakeet.

    Paco arrived accidentally at our home. Initially, he was at my sister's house, and Alexandra, my niece, wanted to keep him. However, she couldn't because she spends most of her time studying outside. So, she gave Paco to my mother, and since then, we've been living with Paco for 7 months. He loves apples and eats almost anything: yuca, potatoes, bananas, any fruit. But he's quite noisy. Sometimes he makes more noise than usual.
    We love him dearly. We're big fans of birds.

## Anecdotes

1. At the age of 15, I traveled by bicycle with friends from Cartago to Pereira (2 hours there, 3 hours back).

    Anecdote:
    When I was 15 years old, I lived in Cartago for a while. Sometimes, I used to ride bicycles with my friends in the neighborhood, and beyond the neighborhood, there were about six of us on bikes. Once, we rode our bicycles to another city called Pereira. It took us two hours to get there and three hours to return. It was quite an adventure at that age—being teenagers.
    We didn't tell our parents because they would have punished us. I remember this time of my life in Cartago with gratitude. I enjoyed it when it happened. My mother was the one who provided the money.

2. Sold 3 heat stations for repairing cellphones for 100,000 pesos, but considered charging more
    Anecdote: On May 28, 2024
    A neighbor from my area, who works as a cellphone repair technician, asked me if I still had three heat stations for repairing cellphones for sale. I said yes. Then he asked me, "How much are you going to sell them for?" I replied, "How much are you offering?" He said 100,000 pesos. So, I told him I would bring them the next day, and I did.
    But it seemed like he offered me too little, and I saw an opportunity to charge him 100,000 pesos and also ask for a second-hand cellphone, of course, in good condition. He agreed to give me the cellphone, but only with 50,000 pesos, which is half of the 100,000 pesos. However, I didn't accept his proposal and returned home with the heat stations.
    Now, here's the funny part of this anecdote: my mother was very curious about why I came back with the stations. I told her that he was offering me half of what we agreed upon plus a cellphone, and I didn't accept it. I wanted the full 100,000 pesos plus the cellphone, but he didn't agree. I pretended to be cleverer than him, and that's when my own mother started playfully teasing me, saying that I'm not the type of person who tricks others with words.
    It was positive teasing, but since I'm not very worldly, which is true, it was quite amusing because she couldn't stop laughing, and that made me laugh too. But deep down, I thought: my mother knows me, and she might think I made a bad deal because I'm not the type of person who can deceive others with words. My tendency is to be a good listener and not talk much. So, it was funny that I tried to be cunning, and of course, it was normal that I couldn't convince the other person to pay me the full 100,000 pesos plus a cellphone.

3. Got a scar on the right wrist after getting trapped in the front wheel of a bicycle
    Anecdote:
    I have a scar that is no longer very noticeable on my right wrist. Let me describe what happened. It was during one of my teenage adventures in Cartago with one of my friends. The two of us rode bicycles to the nearest city called Zaragoza, about 30 minutes away from the village where we lived. That's the name of the village where my family was living at the time.
    We decided to go to Apartado because there were bike tracks there for doing jumps on ramps. We had a lot of fun, and it got late as we headed back. So, on the way back, I had my friend riding on the crossbar of the bicycle, and we decided to switch. It was my turn to climb onto the crossbar while he pedaled the bike. Along the way, there was a pothole that he couldn't avoid, and at that moment, my hand got trapped in the front wheel of the bicycle.
    It was terrible because, besides being trapped, I couldn't release my hand, and it hurt a lot. We fell, but I still couldn't let go of my hand. We had to walk the rest of the way with my hand stuck between the front wheel of the bicycle. Twenty minutes later, we reached the first house in the village, and that's where, with a tool, we managed to free the front wheel and release my hand. That's how I got the scar.

4. Saved Two Girls from Drowning in the Sea (May 26, 2024)
    Anecdote:
    On May 26, 2024, my Aunt Gloria came to visit us. She lives in another city, Cartago, Valle del Cauca, but by plane, the distance is reduced to 45 minutes. She stayed with us for 25 days.
    On the farewell day, with three days left before she returned to her city where she lives with her daughter Leydi, my sister decided to give her a farewell gift by taking her to the beach along with the whole family. The anecdote happened at the beach.
    We were sharing and enjoying ourselves as a family. We had already gone swimming several times. After resting from lunch, which was a delicious fried fish with coconut rice (just thinking about it makes my mouth water again), I decided to go back into the sea. Since I rarely go to the beach, I intended to stay in the water for a long time, bathing and enjoying the scenery, the gentle waves—it was fantastic.
    The astonishing part of the anecdote is that there were three girls, and two of them were drowning. I saved them.
    At first, I didn't believe they were drowning until I asked them, "Is this serious?" It was when I could see their expressions more clearly. One of them coughed up a little vomit and started crying. That's when I reacted very quickly and took the hand of the most frightened girl.
    I managed to take her to a safer spot where she could touch the ground and walk toward the shore. Then I went back for the other girl, who was less scared. I held her hand and did the same. The third girl knew how to swim and was a bit taller, so she made it out on her own. I felt very happy and grateful to God at that moment for allowing me to experience the opportunity to do good for another human being on such a scale.
    Another aspect that made my task easier was my height relative to where we were. The water level wasn't too high for me, and I could touch the ground. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult because I understand that a person who is drowning can inadvertently drown someone trying to save them.
    Thank God, everything ended well, and my mother said the following words: "My child, God wanted you to be here for that reason."

2. Anecdote with My University Classmates: We were in a psychology class, and the professor decided to teach us about artificial intelligence through the movie "AI." In the film, a mother with a comatose son is assigned a robot child with artificial intelligence. Honestly, that movie struck me as very dramatic. I couldn't control my tears—I was crying and laughing with my classmates at the same time. Wow, I'll never forget that experience.
