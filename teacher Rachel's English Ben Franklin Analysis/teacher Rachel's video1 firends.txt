Today is the third video this December where we're using the Friends Christmas episode, 
the one where Rachel quits her job to study English. 
Last week she had a job interview. 
Now in this episode, she's gotten the job and it's her last day working at the coffee shop.

We're going to study this scene and everything we can about American English pronunciation
to figure out what makes American English sound American.

Here's the scene: 
there you go. Enjoy. 
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
No. 
Excuse me everyone, 
this is my last night working here. 
I just wanted to say that 
I made some really good friends here, 
and it's time to move on. 
As of this moment, 
I will never have to make coffee again. 

And now, let's do the analysis together: 
There you go. 
Okay, our first thought group here is three words long. 
What is the stress? 
What's the most stressed word? 
"There you go." 
There you go. 
There you go. 
The stress is all going up towards the peak; 
the energy peaks out on the word "go" that has the "O" diphthong. 
You will need some lip rounding for that. 
"There you." 
Going up in pitch, going up in energy, and volume. 
"There you go." 
And then the up-down shape on the stressed syllable. 
"There you go."
"There you go."
"There you go." 
Try to do that, try to do it really smoothly connected 
with that peak, of stress on "go." 


You'll listen to it three times, 
then there will be a brief pause for you to try it. 
There you go. There you go. There you go. 
Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. 
Second syllable stress. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. 
So the context here is Rachel's last shift, 
the end of her last shift. 
She did get a job in the video that we studied last week, 
this section of the episode. 
She had just had an interview where she didn't feel like she did very well, 
but she did get the job. And so this is her last shift 
and she knows that she has a job "to move on to." 
Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.
Clap, clap! or  Applause, applause!
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
No. 
Okay, Chandler didn't actually order coffee. 
What is the stress of his question here? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea?


Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
No. 
Okay, 
Chandler didn't actually order coffee. 
What is the stress of his question here? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Should I tell her I ordered tea?

Should I tell her, the verb, 
should I tell her I ordered tea, tea, 
and the pitch goes up, it's a yes, no question. 
Those are our two most stressed syllables there. 
Should I, 
the word should, I would say is, 
I would write that with a schwa, 
should, should, should I, should I, 
the D is a flap sound because it comes between two vowels or diphthongs, 
the L is silent here, 
so it comes between the schwa and the I diphthong, 
so it's just should I, should I, da-da-da-da-da-da, 
the tongue bouncing on the roof of the mouth. 
Should I tell her? 
Should I tell her?
Should I tell her? 


Should I tell her? 
Tell begins with a true T, 
because that starts a stressed syllable, that's always going to be a true T, 
unless it's the TR cluster, then it might be a CH sound. 
Tell her. 
We have a dropped H, the ER, the schwa R ending just links on to the word before 
tell her, tell her. 
Should I tell her? 
Should I tell her? 
Should I tell her? 
Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
I ordered both a little flatter, lower in pitch. 
I ordered, I ordered, I ordered, 
I ordered tea 
before the stressed word tea. 
And again, that is a true T because the T there begins a stressed syllable. 
I ordered, I ordered, I ordered

Tough, 
I actually have a video that goes over how to pronounce that word when it's stressed. 
You can check it out. I'll put a link in the video description. 
I ordered tea?, I ordered tea? , I ordered tea?  
No. No. No. No. 
Quick up-down shape. No, no.
