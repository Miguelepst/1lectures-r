The difference between "affect" and "effect" can be a bit tricky, as they are often confused. Here's a simple explanation:

- **Affect** is usually used as a verb, meaning to influence or produce a change in something.
  - Example: "The loud noise affected my concentration."

- **Effect** is usually used as a noun, meaning the result or outcome of something.
  - Example: "The new policy had a positive effect on employee morale."

In some cases, "effect" can also be used as a verb, meaning to bring about or accomplish something, but this is less common.
- Example: "The new manager hoped to effect positive changes in the company."

Remember, "affect" is typically a verb, and "effect" is typically a noun, but there are exceptions and nuances to their usage.
