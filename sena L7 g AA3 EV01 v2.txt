Hello everyone!, this is Miguel Gutierrez ​from English Course Level 7.​

And in this video We are going to learn about the topic: ​
Narrate life experiences and past routines, taking into account the use of complex structures in the simple past tense.

Very well, let's have fun.​

Oh! I almost forgot, our mission. ok


Our Mission!!!

Effectively presents information describing a memorable past experience and provides details using the past simple tense.

Demonstrates competence in using the past simple tense, "used to," connectors, and appropriate temporal expressions for the past.

And, of course, what we like the most, a lot of new vocabulary, among other things. 

But I'll stop here because it seems the mission is a bit lengthy, and I don't want to bore you. 

So let's get started right away.

-

ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a young boy who CAREFULLY built a model airplane. 

He worked on it SLOWLY, putting each piece together SIMPLY and EASILY. 

His dream was to fly it LOUDLY across the park SUCCESSFULLY. 

He tried many times and failed TOO often. 

But COMPLETELY determined, he kept trying.

MEANWHILE, in the park, an old man watched the boy daily. SUDDENLY, one day, the wind was perfect. 

LATER, the boy threw the plane with all his might. AFTERWARDS, he watched it soar. 

WHEN the plane landed, the boy ran to it FINALLY seeing his work fly. 
AT THE END of the day, the boy was so happy.

BY THE TIME he went home, the sun was setting. 

BY THE WAY, he met the old man who smiled. 

BEFORE he left, the old man gave him a tip to make the plane fly better. 

FOR A LONG time, the boy had been waiting for someone to notice his efforts. 

I'M NOT SURPRISED, the boy thought, as he felt the old man knew much about planes. 

YOU'RE JOKING?, the boy said when the old man told him he had once been a pilot. 

"I CAN IMAGINE!" the boy exclaimed, imagining flying real airplanes.

WHAT A NIGHTMARE, he thought, if the plane would have broken. 

SOUNDS AWFUL if he would never have met the pilot. 

SOUNDS TERRIBLE, that he almost gave up. 

I DON'T BLAME YOU, said the pilot, understanding the difficulty of pursuing dreams. 

WOW, THAT'S AMAZING! exclaimed the boy when the pilot showed him an old photo of a plane he had flown.


OH, how excited the boy was. I SEE, said the boy, when the pilot explained aerodynamics. 

WHAT YOU MEAN is that the shape is important, the boy realized. 

LUCKY YOU, to have learned these things, the boy told the pilot. 

"OH MY GOD! WERE YOU REALLY a war pilot?" asked the boy, amazed. 

SO, the pilot answered his many questions.

WHAT HAPPENED? Why did you stop flying? The boy inquired. 

YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, the boy reacted to the story of the pilot's last flight. 

I am SERIOUS, the pilot replied with a twinkle in his eye. 

They spent the whole afternoon discussing planes. 

Time passed JUST as fast as the boy's plane flying in the wind. 

It was ALREADY sunset and YET, the boy wanted to talk more. STILL, it was getting dark.

FOR AND SINCE that day, the boy visited the old pilot. 

Many seasons had passed, AGO, YESTERDAY, and THE OTHER DAY LAST WEEK. 

Now it was LAST MONTH, then LAST YEAR, but the boy never forgot the pilot's lessons. 

He USED TO think he knew everything about planes until the pilot taught him more. 

Indeed, the boy often laughed recalling their first meeting. 

I WOULD always remember, the boy thought, the day I really learned to fly.

Okay, end of the story. Well, at least for now.

And now what do we do? What's next?

Well, how about we simplify the previous "story full of exquisite and new vocabulary highlighted in uppercase" to what we aim to learn in this presentation.


According to the recommendations of Teacher Valentina Andrea, it is a document: in history, in the story, in the anecdote. 

I will not limit them to only a chronicle. Let everything have a link, beginning and end, all interconnected.

Use the following structures:

1. Simple past tense.
2. Present perfect tense.
3. Past perfect tense.

Remembering Instructor Valentina's recommendation:
Retrieve the information from the training material.
Please do it individually, please, please!.


1. Simple past tense:
In English, the simple past tense is used to talk about actions or events that happened in the past and are completed.

We often form the simple past by adding "-ed" to regular verbs. However, irregular verbs have different forms.

Structure:
The basic structure of a simple past sentence is:

Subject + Past Verb + Object 

Affirmative  : 
Subject + Past Verb + Object    
* which would be the same: 
Subject + Base Verb + "-ed"       

Negative     : 
Subject + Did not(didn't) + The base form of the verb 

Interrogative: 
Did + Subject + The base form of the verb + ? 


Explanation:

Subject: The person or thing that performs the action.

Past Verb: The past tense form of the verb. 

For regular verbs, this is often formed by adding "-ed" to the base form. 

For irregular verbs, it is a unique past tense form.

Object: The person or thing that receives the action.

Examples:

Be (Irregular verb):

Statement: I was at the store.

Explanation:

Subject: I

Past Verb: was 
(past tense of "am/is/are")

Object: at the store

Go (Irregular verb):

Statement: She went to the park.

Explanation:

Subject: She

Past Verb: went (past tense of "go")

Object: to the park

These examples illustrate the use of the simple past tense with the verbs "be" and "go." 

Keep in mind that while "be" is irregular and has its unique forms (am, is, are, was, were), "go" is also irregular but follows a different pattern in the past tense (go, went). 

Regular verbs, on the other hand, typically form the past tense by adding "-ed" to the base form 
(e.g., walk, walked).


2. Present Perfect tense: 
Like everything else, there are three ways, forms, or structures in the sentence:

Affirmative  : 
Subject            
+ Auxiliary have/has 
+ past participle of the verb 
+ Complement

Negative     : 
Subject            
+ Auxiliary have/has 
+ Not 
+ past participle of the verb 
+ Complement

Interrogative: 
Auxiliary have/has 
+ Subject            
+ past participle of the verb 
+ Complement

NOTE: Its correct use is necessary to express experiences or memories that happened in the past,
but are still remembered or have importance in the present.


3. Past perfect tense:
The past perfect tense is used to indicate that an action was completed before another action took place in the past. 

It is formed by using the past tense of the auxiliary verb ""have"" (had) and the past participle of the main verb.

Structure:

Affirmative  : 
Subject 
+ had     
+ past participle  

Negative     : 
Subject 
+ had not 
+ past participle 
(or Subject + hadn't + past participle)

Interrogative: 
Had 
+ Subject 
+ past participle 
+ ? 


Affirmative: 
Subject 
+ had 
+ past participle

Example:
She had eaten breakfast before the meeting.

Negative: 
Subject 
+ had not 
+ past participle 
(or Subject + hadn't + past participle)

Example:
They hadn't visited the museum before last week.

Interrogative: 
Had 
+ Subject 
+ past participle?

Example:
Had you seen that movie before yesterday?

Now, let's use ""be"" and ""go"" as examples:

Using ""be"" as the main verb:

Affirmative:
I had been to Paris before.

Negative:
She hadn't been to the beach until last summer.

Interrogative:
Had they been to that restaurant before?

Using ""go"" as the main verb:

Affirmative:
He had gone to the store when I called.

Negative:
We hadn't gone to the new mall before yesterday.

Interrogative:
Had she gone to the concert last night?

These examples illustrate how the past perfect tense is formed with the verbs ""be"" and ""go"" in affirmative, negative, 
and interrogative forms. 

Remember that ""had"" is the past tense of the auxiliary verb ""have"" and the past participle is used after it to complete the tense.


Okay, it's time to go back to the story of the young boy and the pilot to apply what we have learned:

1. Simple past tense

A summarized example of the 'Simple Past Tense' in the story of the young man and the pilot would be something like the following:

As years slid by, the boy grew into a skilled pilot himself. 

Each flight he commanded was a tribute to the old man's wisdom. 

EVERY SUMMER, he'd return to the park, remembering the tentative launches of his youthful dreams. 

ONCE, he even spotted a child with a model plane, struggling as he once did. 

INSTINCTIVELY, he approached, ready to pass on the legacy of patience and perseverance. 

The cycle of teaching and learning continued, AS the young boy-turned-pilot became the mentor, creating a story that would echo THROUGH THE GENERATIONS.

Affirmative  : 
He mastered flight, a testament to the old man's guidance.

Negative     : 
He didn't enjoy the flight; it was a disappointing experience.

Interrogative: 
Did the boy spot a child struggling with a model?


2. Present perfect tense
A summarized example of the 'Present Perfect Tense' in the story of the young man and the pilot would be something like the following:

The relationship between the boy and the pilot grew stronger as time went on, and the boy's skills improved significantly. 

He has built several model airplanes since then, each more sophisticated than the last. 

The advice given to him by the pilot has been invaluable, with each tip and technique elevating his craft to new heights. 

Recently, the boy has even started to teach others in the park, sharing the wisdom he once received. 

He appreciates every moment of endeavour and believes that without the pilot's guidance, he wouldn't have achieved so much. 

Every time he watches one of his planes soar gracefully through the sky, he silently thanks the old pilot, the unexpected mentor who has had such a profound impact on his life.

Affirmative  : 
The boy has achieved remarkable progress in building model airplanes.

Negative     :
 The boy hasn't encountered any major setbacks in his progress.

Interrogative: 
Has the boy's relationship with the pilot transformed his skills?


3. Past perfect tense.

A simplified example of the "Past Perfect Tense" in the story of the young man and the pilot would be something like the following:

The boy had always believed flying was just a matter of strength, but he'd been wrong until the old pilot came along. 

He had never understood why his plane struggled against the breeze until that fateful day when the man with the silver hair explained the intricacies of lift and drag. 

Before the meeting, the boy had been unaware of the precise techniques required, yet the old pilot had seen potential in the thrown-together model aircraft. 

With the advice he'd been given, he had perfected the plane's design. 

The boy had fixed the wings and adjusted the weight distribution as suggested, and his plane had flown further than he had ever dreamed possible. 

His friendship with the pilot had not only taught him about aeronautics; it had become a treasure he knew he would cherish in all the years to come.

Affirmative  : 
He had fixed the wings and adjusted, making his plane soar.

Negative     : 
The boy had never grasped the nuances of flight before.

Interrogative: 
Had the boy ever imagined his plane would soar so far?
