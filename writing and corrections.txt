question 5:chat gpt: Show me another way to say the same thing English A2:
Hey there! Morning! 😄 So, yesterday was a bit weird for me. I thought the meeting was at 11 am, but then I realized it was actually at 10 pm. That's why I double-checked the time with you. But, unfortunately, the link was wrong this time. No biggie though, we'll nail it next time! Thanks a bunch, and have an awesome day! 🌟


question 5:chat gpt: Show me another way to say the same thing English A2:
Hey there, buddy! Morning! 😄
Yeah, you know what? Yesterday felt a bit odd to me too. I had set it for 11 am in my planner, but something seemed off. That's why I double-checked about the meeting time. Ended up switching it to 10 pm. But hey, wrong link this time, no biggie! We'll nail it next time, alright? Thanks a bunch, buddy! Have an awesome day ahead! 🌟👍


question 4:chat gpt: Show me another way to say the same thing English A2:
Hey there! Good morning! 😄
Yeah, buddy, you were spot on. Yesterday felt a bit odd for me too because when I marked it in my calendar, it seemed like 11 am. That's why I double-checked about the meeting time. Then I switched it to 10 pm. But, alas, it seems I got the wrong link this time. No sweat, though, my friend. Next time, we'll nail it. Thanks a bunch, buddy. Have an awesome day! 🌟

question 3:chat gpt: 
chat gpt: Please add the following corrections to the second paragraph:

Hi, my bro. Good morning! 🤭 
Yeah, my friend, you're right, 
that was a little strange for me yesterday 
because when I set it in my schedule, the time looked like 11am. 
Is that why I was asking again about the scheduled time of the meeting? 
Then I changed the time to 10pm. 
But yeah, it's the wrong link for this time, 
but don't worry, my bro, 
the next time, we'll get it. 
Thank you, my bro, 
I hope you have a wonderful day 🤗🙏

original in spanish:
Hola mi hermano, buenos dias, 🤭, si my hemano tu tienes razon, eso fue un poco estraño para mi ayer, porque cuando fije el tiempo en mi horario, en mi horario la hora era 11am, 
es por eso que te pregunte nuevamente sobre la hora de la reunion en el horario, entonces cambie la hora de la reunion a 10pm.
pero si, es el enlace equivocado para este tiempo, pero no nos preocupemos mi hermano, la prosima vez lo lograremos. gracias mi hermano, y espero que tengas un maravilloso dia  🤗🙏    

last version in spanish:
Hola, hermano. ¡Buenos días! 🤭
Sí, amigo mío, tienes razón,
ayer eso fue un poco extraño para mí
porque cuando lo programé en mi agenda, la hora parecía ser las 11 am.
¿Es por eso que preguntaba de nuevo sobre la hora programada de la reunión?
Entonces cambié la hora a las 10 pm.
Pero sí, es el enlace equivocado para esta hora,
pero no te preocupes, hermano,
la próxima vez lo lograremos.
Gracias, hermano,
espero que tengas un día maravilloso 🤗🙏
